1no1rw5,autism,WindermerePeaks1,"US - Fact Checking Trump and RFK's remarks on the cause of Autism. For those that aren't aware, president Trump had a press conference two hours ago about finding the cause of Autism. He was not fact checked, but we are doing our best to do that for you. For the sake of clarity across countries, acetaminophen, paracetamol, and tylenol are the same drug. Trump's main statements were: 1. Autism is an epidemic 2. Acetaminophen use during pregnancy causes autism, pregnant people shouldn't take it, and there's ""no downside to not taking it"". And says places like Cuba can’t afford tylenol so they don’t use it and they “have virtually no autism”. 3. Hepatitis B vaccines should not be given until the age of 12 because Hep B is a sexually transmitted disease and babies don't have sex. 4. Children are ""loaded up with"" as many as 80 vaccines at once. 5. He stated that the Amish community has very little autism due to not getting vaccinated or taking tylenol. 5. RFK said the department identified an ""exciting therapy that may benefit large numbers of children who suffer from autism."" Referring to Leucovorin. 6. 70% of mothers believe that vaccines caused their child’s autism and that we should “believe the women”. ## **FACT CHECKS** **EPIDEMIC CLAIMS** 1. The rates of autism have increased largely due to increased awareness of the disorder and changes in how it is classified by medical professionals. This rate that is referenced is based on diagnosis and doesn't necessarily mean autism itself has increased, just that diagnosis have. 2. Every time there’s been a significant increase in autism diagnoses, it’s after a new edition of the DSM is published. Autism diagnoses skyrocketed after 1980 because the DSM-III was published that year, and in that edition autism was officially separated from schizophrenia and reclassified as a communication disorder. There was another increase after 2013 when the DSM-V was published with “autism spectrum disorder” as a developmental disorder, instead of five separate disorders. In order to understand how autism is not an epidemic, we have to look at how the meaning (and diagnostic criteria and diagnosis rates) has changed over time. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3757918/ 2. The definition of epidemic is “a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a community at a particular time” - oxford, “an outbreak of disease that spreads quickly and affects many individuals at the same time” - marriam webster, “sudden disease outbreak that affects a large number of people in a particular region, community, or population” -national geographic. 3. Autism however has gradually increased over the years. It’s not an immediate change. - Compared to 20 years ago, we're now seeing more children identified with autism who identify as Black, Asian, and Pacific Islander than white. We used to think primarily white boys were impacted by autism, but now we see it's all of us—many of our communities have children with autism in them—and not just boys. Over 1% of girls are identified with autism. - So, we know the number of children identified with autism is increasing. - There has been a nearly 300% increase over the past 20 years, but if you look at any two-year period across the sites that are monitoring the number of children identified with autism, it’s somewhere between a 10%–20% increase every two years. https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/is-there-an-autism-epidemic **VACCINES** 1. Hepatitis B is transmitted during birth and children can also come into contact with it through household objects like razors, toothbrushes, and towels. 2. Children are not ""loaded up"" with 80 vaccines at a time. The CDC has developed the childhood vaccine schedule over decades, in close consultation with experts, based on thorough reviews of safety and efficacy evidence. The schedule can be found here: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11288-childhood-immunization-schedule. No one has ever gotten 80 vaccines at a time. He also stated they should break up the MMR vaccine into four or five doses. The MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) only consists of three vaccines. Vaccines are combined because it reduces the amount of pokes that have to be done. Before a combination vaccine is approved for use, it goes through careful testing to make sure the combination vaccine is as safe and effective as each of the individual vaccines given separately. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/about/combination-vaccines.html 3. During the press conference, Trump said he’s a believer in vaccines but claimed without evidence that giving vaccinations close together at the recommended ages has a link to autism. Spacing out shots as he suggests can lead to an increased risk that children become infected with a vaccine-preventable disease before returning for another visit. Though anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy, have long suggested a link between vaccines and autism, **widespread scientific consensus and decades of studies have firmly concluded there isn’t one**. 4. As for the Amish claims, it’s very hard to actually know. There’s not a lot of data. One paper published in 2010 https://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2010/webprogram/Paper7336.html said, “Preliminary data have identified the presence of ASD in the Amish community at a rate of approximately 1 in 271 children using standard ASD screening and diagnostic tools although some modifications may be in order.” That rate was lower than the general population (which at the time was 1 in 91) the paper noted, but that could be due to a variety of factors, including differences in how caregivers answered screening questions or genetic differences. The sample taken for the study was 1,899 children from two Amish communities. The DSM IV was used. This is important because the diagnostic criteria was different, as asperger’s, pervasive developmental disorder, and autistic disorder were combined. While something may be here, it’s still inconclusive. The vaccination rates among the Amish are also hard to know because there’s not much data, but one paper from 2017 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655317300962?via%3Dihub found that 98% of the parents surveyed vaccinated their children. Another paper from 2011 https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/128/1/79/30323/Underimmunization-in-Ohio-s-Amish-Parental-Fears?autologincheck=redirected found that 85% had vaccinated at least some of their children. **ACETAMINOPHEN** 1. Pregnant women are already advised to take acetaminophen sparingly, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Fevers pose a risk to both the mother and the developing fetus. Studies that have been conducted to evaluate a connection between acetaminophen use and autism have so far been **inconclusive.** Multiple agencies around the world have determined the risk is inconclusive, meaning **there is no established risk.** 2. Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, the president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a statement two hours ago stressing that acetaminophen is considered safe. ""The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality [death] for the pregnant person and the fetus. 3. The Trump Administration is citing [a literature review published last month](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0). Outside researchers have reviewed that article saying the review wasn’t rigorously conducted and that it cherry picked studies that supported its conclusion. The review’s senior author, Andrea Baccarelli, served in 2023 as a paid expert in a class action lawsuit against acetaminophen manufacturers, in which he testified that there was a link between the medication and autism. A judge excluded his testimony for being **scientifically unsound** and last year **dismissed the case, which is currently under appeal.** (This means that the author of a review paper that Trump is using to back the claims is biased. That case is ongoing). 3. Other autism researcher have pointed to a large study last year [published in the Journal of the American Medical Association](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406) which found **no link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability.** - This study analyzed data from more than 2.4 million children. When the researchers looked solely at children with autism, there was a small increased risk possibly associated with acetaminophen. But when the researchers compared siblings within the same families the link disappeared. The comparison allowed them to control for variables that past studies couldn’t. Siblings share a large part of their genetic background and often have similar environmental exposures in utero and at home. - “The biggest elephant in the room here is genetics,” Lee said. “We know that autism, ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders are highly heritable.” **LEUCOVORIN** Leucovorin is a form of Vitamin B. It has never before been **approved** for autism symptoms, though it has been used “off label”for some autism symptoms. The FDA has issued a statement that they are approving its usage for a subset of children with autism who have ""cerebral folate deficiency."" Cerebral folate deficiency can be diagnosed via a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) or with a FRAT test. **No clinical trials have been done**. The FDA's endorsement of the drug without the company submitting clinical trials to treat kids with autism is **highly unusual.** The science regarding leucovorin and autism ""is still in very early stages, and more studies are necessary before a definitive conclusion can be reached,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement. The data in favor of treatment with leucovorin is “from four small randomized controlled trials, all using different doses and different outcomes, and in one case, reliant on a specific genetic variant,” the Foundation notes [on its website](https://autismsciencefoundation.org/press_releases/statement-from-autism-science-foundation-regarding-wall-street-journal-report-rfk-jr-hhs-to-link-autism-to-tylenol-use-in-pregnancy-and-folate-deficiencies/). It’s important to note as well that these studies only had a small sample size, 40 or 50 patients. In the research world, that’s a very small sample size. It doesn’t mean it’s bad, just that there **isn’t enough data yet**. Dr. David Mandell, a professor of psychiatry and autism expert at the University of Pennsylvania, told Reuters that leucovorin might well be a possible treatment for some children with autism, ""but the evidence we have supporting it... is really, really weak."" **The Autism Science Foundation [does not endorse leucovorin as a treatment for autism](https://autismsciencefoundation.org/beware-of-non-evidence-based-treatments)**, saying in a statement that “more studies are necessary before a conclusion can be reached.” Side effects may include gastrointestinal distress, weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite, changes in taste and hair loss. Allergic reactions, seizures and infections may occur in rare but severe cases. The long-term effects of the drug are unknown. It’s important to note that of the doctors using leucovorin for autism that leucovorin on its own **isn’t a cure-all**. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist researching leucovorin as a potential autism treatment said that while his patients were taking the medication, they also continued other therapeutic interventions, such as applied behavior analysis and speech therapy. Despite this, the Trump Administration has decided to fast track FDA approval of leucovorin for the treatment of autism. **This post will be updated with fact checks as we get them.** ## **UK Response** Here's the UK response.

1np2ooo,changemyview,Tessenreacts,"CMV: The conservative view on Tylenol and autism is a tragic indictment of American anti-intellectualism.. President Trump and members of his cabinet have continued their crusade against autism, through now stating that Tylenol (moreso the components of it) causes autism. This also goes hand in hand with statements made in March stating that people with autism don't have jobs and aren't contributing members of society. This renewed push against autism through stating that Tylenol causes autism, is not only objectively incorrect, it's part of the conservative effort to replace rigid peer reviewed and tested academia, with reactionary approaches and policies that exclusively sounds good on paper and in their heads, but falls apart when examined with even the lightest impartial research into the subject. American anti-intellectualism DEFINITELY isn't exclusively a conservative phenomenon, as members of the left absolutely engages in that behavior as well, but conservatives consistently are the loudest and most willing to turn their anti-intellectual viewpoints into actual political policy. But the Tylenol and autism issue is only a symptom of the core problem that is anti-intellectualism, and American appeal to reactionary approaches rather than engaging in the peer review process to actually make sure that what they are saying is correct.

EDIT: [Link to video of the announcement on PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trump-expected-to-make-announcement-on-autism) Today Trump is going to announce that they have found conclusive evidence that autism is directly caused by mothers consuming Tylenol/acetaminophen (they’re the same thing Tylenol is a brand name) while pregnant which gives the fetus autism. Obviously, if you’ve read even a small amount of information regarding this, then you know this is bogus. Autism is far too complex to simply be linked to one cause and is still being actively researched to understand the **various** factors that play into it (genetics, developmental factors, etc).

We have a resources page linked on the sidebar and here https://reddit.com/r/autisminwomen/wiki/resources which has things we have found helpful for ourselves. My favorite is The Neurodivergent Book of DBT Skills. In this instance, I’d say distress tolerance and emotional regulation would be the skills to focus on. Give yourself grace today, don’t respond to people rage baiting you (purposely trying to make you mad), trolling, or otherwise just upsetting you with bullheaded ignorance. It’s okay to put dad on mute for the day if he’s just spouting off nonsense. Here is a good boundary message for before you mute people, I wrote it specifically for close family that you’re already fed up with but you can definitely tweak it to remove sentences or change them: “This is not a topic I wish to talk about with you or anyone else. I would prefer if our conversations did not include politics as it should be clear by now that I find them to be uncomfortable and not conducive to us having a good relationship. From now on, I will no longer respond to politically charged messages. I am putting myself and my own mental wellbeing first. If you care about me as I do you, you will respect this and find someone else to discuss politics with. If not, then I will have to distance myself and eventually block you if you don’t stop.” The person will probably freak out for the rest of the day about a boundary being established but boundaries are about you and what you will and will not put up with. This is why you mute their notifications so they can have their tantrum on their own without overwhelming you with 500 text messages an hour. On iPhone, go to your text thread then tap their name. Then slide the “hide alerts” button to green. Make sure to stick to it and block them if they keep on sending political messages. Trust me, if someone needs to reach out to you about something actually important they will. Again, be kind to yourself today and everyday. I know it is very frustrating and upsetting to witness this. ———- Copied from previous megathread and tweaked slightly: If you want to learn about current protests and actions being taken in US, please check out r/50501 or your local subreddits and other groups.

1nowzaf,autismmemes,_RPGabe_,"Mod statement regarding autism and Tylenol. Hello everyone, The mod-team has come together and decided to give a statement regarding Donald Trump and RFK Jr. saying Tylenol/acetaminophen/paracetamol causes autism. We don't know what public policy repercussions, if any, will come in the future from these words, but we felt it was important to give context and clear up a few misconceptions. First, correlation between Tylenol and autism has not been proven with any rigorous scientific analysis.[ This article from PBS ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/research-doesnt-show-using-tylenol-during-pregnancy-causes-autism-here-are-5-things-to-know)gives a good overview, as well as this interview from [Yale School of Public Health](https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/what-the-research-says-about-autism-and-tylenol-use-during-pregnancy/). Both of these articles have references of their own as well for further reading. While some studies may claim there is an association, there is a different between association and correlation, or association and causation. Second, it's important to highlight why the Trump administration is pushing this agenda. As highlighted in the references above, Tylenol is consistently the most safe pain medication to take during pregnancy. This is clearly part of the continuous attack on reproductive rights. It is also worth mentioning that the alternative being pushed is leucovorin, otherwise known as folinic acid. Folinic acid is sold by Dr. Oz, a celebrity quack doctor who is the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Trump administration. Dr. Oz's company website, iHerb, has a disclaimer saying, ""[ Not Healthcare Advice The products and claims made about specific products on or through this Site have not been evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration and are not approved to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease.](https://nl.iherb.com/info/disclaimer)"" iHerb and Dr. Oz have consistently failed to meet FDA guidelines, follow scientific standards, and much more. FDA guidelines under Trump may change in the future, but this is still an important piece to highlight. Just like with Elon Musk gutting the government, Trump has filled the US government with his colleagues and business partners and are consistently trying to make revenue, at the expense of us. Last but not least, it is important to push back against the eugenicist arguments stemming from this. The underlying assumption, or warrant in these people's arguments, is that having autism is inherently wrong and therefore it must be destroyed. The truth is that autistic people are valid, wonderful, and an integral part of societies of the past, present, and future. There is no getting rid of us, and the world would not be better without us. Many of the troubles that come with being autistic are often external factors. This can look like parents and peers not knowing how to be supportive, a lack of accommodations, general misconceptions people have, minimal disability rights globally, and so much more. A world that centers disability rights and accommodations is a world that is more accessible and better for everyone. Instead of blaming individuals and constantly criminalizing more and more, we should seek to create systems and societies that uplift everyone. That will help far more than criminalizing/banning Tylenol, and the other things that the Trump administration pushes like criminalizing homelessness, funding more and more police and ICE, and stripping people of their autonomy and humanity, are all part of this same ideology and are connected. It's not often we make mod statements, especially political ones, but in this day and age, not making a statement is a position in itself. We refuse to be silent as we and others are targeted. Now, more than ever, it is important we fight back against a wave of lies, fascism, and dangerous rhetoric. We must seek to build community, find ways of resisting, and come together. We might just be a meme subreddit, but we hope to be a part of community and help build it online (which is not a substitute for real life organizing!) and create a space that is safe for all of us. And that means calling out bullshit. All that to say, posts spreading misinformation are not acceptable. There is a line between memes and humor and promoting unscientific facts as truth. While there are some concerns about [irony poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony_poisoning), posts making fun of this admittedly absurd statement are not outright banned, as of this moment. Just keep in mind the context your posts are made in. Stay safe everyone. Go pop a Tylenol for the headache Trump's statements are giving us.

1no6ev7,NewsThread,Former_Goose_5202,"Trump Urges Pregnant Women to Avoid Tylenol Over Autism Concerns. US President Donald Trump has urged pregnant women to avoid using Tylenol, claiming there is a possible link between the pain reliever and autism. Speaking from the Oval Office alongside Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump said the drug, also known as paracetamol or acetaminophen, should only be taken during pregnancy in cases of extreme fever. The announcement comes as health authorities prepare to advise doctors against prescribing the medication to expectant mothers. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to issue a notice to physicians, initiate a label change, and launch a public health campaign highlighting potential risks. Trump described the rise in autism cases as a “horrible crisis.” Kennedy added that the FDA will soon approve Leucovorin, a decades-old drug traditionally used in cancer treatment, as a therapy for some children with autism linked to folate deficiency. Medical experts, however, have cautioned that the evidence linking Tylenol to autism is inconclusive, and that acetaminophen remains one of the safest pain relief options available to pregnant women. Studies have produced conflicting results, with some suggesting a possible connection while others find no clear association. Autism rates have risen significantly in recent decades, though researchers attribute much of the increase to broader diagnostic criteria and improved awareness. Experts continue to stress that autism likely results from a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors rather than a single cause.",0.0,0.0,0.0,post,2025-09-23 03:02:28,https://i.redd.it/z4gdv6odytqf1.jpeg,/r/NewsThread/comments/1no6ev7/trump_urges_pregnant_women_to_avoid_tylenol_over/,i.redd.it,189.0,,0.0

1no1enc,AutisticPride,DragonflyKey4972,"Trump and RFK's big, beautiful autism answer. They made it official. Pregnant women taking Tylenol causes it, according to the pumpkin and worm-brain man. Autism runs in my family from way back including my maternal grandparents (both born before 1920). My mom had two cousins (born in the mid-1940s) who were autistic and the Soviets took the girl away and turned her into a vegetable and then she died, so they could try to ""cure"" her. Although acetaminophen was discovered in 1878, it was NOT rolled out to consumers until 1956. They believe da Vinci and other great artists/inventors were autistic. The only answer is-- their moms had time travel machines, came to the future and stocked up on Tylenol. Also, my mom did not take Tylenol while pregnant with me. And she was happy, lived in a small town, and they grew their own fruits and veggies. Also-- we're to assume then, that most mothers never took Tylenol since most people are NT? BTW, our newspaper had an article that-- BEFORE this ""research,"" RFK and Trump DEFUNDED the other autism research groups and then made everyone apply under RFK. One anonymous scientist said he hopes the groups won't bend to RFK's (psycho) will to get funding.

1nowq8g,AskUS,No-Chemist8230,"Could the Tylenol–autism controversy shift Trump supporter opinions?. I feel like this would cause a “now wait a minute…” type of thought even for those who support Trump. When it came to the whole “vaccines cause autism” argument I could see why people would be more trusting of that claim, not saying I believe it, but I can see why. People really only get it a handful of times; the only time I remember I got a vaccination other than my COVID shot was when I was a child for like the usual stuff (measles, chickenpox, ect.). But Tylenol is so common? I feel as though everyone has used it once in their life, or have used medications with the main ingredient such as NyQuil, Midol, Alka-Setzer Cold&Flu, Mucinex, and more. Like that’s why a lot of people end up accidentally overdosing because they don’t realize how pervasive acetaminophen is as an ingredient in OTC medication. I feel like if it was truly a risk for autism it would’ve been recognized already with how common it is, globally recognized considering it’s a common medication in other countries. I don’t know, I mean hey, you can disagree with your own party but I feel like a majority of Trump supporters (not to be disrespectful) follow his claims blindly (even now I see people trying to repost the Harvard study thinking it’s proof of causation when there is a literal excerpt in the study saying it’s not).

I was diagnosed with autism in the 1990s and have been travelling around the country for years interviewing autistic people about their experiences, which are chronicled in my book *We’re Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation*. I am also the recipient of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network's Harriet McBryde Johnson Prize for Nonfiction Writing. In the years since the anti-vaccine panic that Kennedy elevated, we have seen an improvement in how society views autistic people. But the Trump administration is putting that progress at risk. By spreading claims that vaccines and tylenol use during pregnancy cause autism, the administration is implying that autism is something to be feared and eliminated. In addition to Trump and RFK Jr’s recent announcement around acetaminophen, the administration said that the FDA would establish leucovorin, a type of folic acid, as the “first recognized therapeutic treatment for children with certain types of autism spectrums.” Medical evidence for the FDA's new recommendation was not immediately provided.

1nodtnk,atlanticdiscussions,Bonegirl06,"Trump Tells Pregnant Women to ‘Fight Like Hell’ Not to Take Tylenol. ""At a press conference today, President Donald Trump dispensed one clear piece of medical advice to American parents in a rambling, repetitive monologue: Don’t. Take. Tylenol. He told pregnant women that they could help keep their children safe from autism by not taking the drug whenever they could avoid it (“fight like hell,” he instructed). He advised parents not to give Tylenol to their young children. He denounced giving the hepatitis B vaccine to infants and suggested that parents space out their children’s immunization schedule. (“They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it’s a disgrace,” he said.) He declared that children ideally should be given the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines separately, though such individual shots are not available in the United States. “This is based on what I feel,” the president said. Trump had been hinting at his big announcement for weeks, and it was evident that he wasn’t interested in making sure the contents had passed through the normal research process. “I don’t want to wait any longer. We don’t need anything more. And if it’s wrong—it’s not going to be wrong, but—if it is wrong, it’s fine. We have to do it,” Trump told the audience at a dinner for the American Cornerstone Institute on Saturday. Today, instead of opting for measured guidance, or urging additional research, Trump borrowed a strategy from his health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: pushing ahead with a sensational conclusion based on a handful of disputed studies."" ... ""During today’s announcement, Kennedy at least acknowledged the trade-offs inherent in scaring pregnant Americans off Tylenol, and allowed that, sometimes, using it is unavoidable. “The FDA also recognizes that acetaminophen is often the only tool for fevers and pain in pregnancy, as other alternatives have well-documented adverse effects,” Kennedy noted in his remarks. “HHS wants therefore to encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in the use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose and shortest necessary duration, and only when treatment is required.” (Today, the FDA posted an even more measured notice to physicians, signed by Makary, that underscored a possible association between acetaminophen and autism is “an ongoing area of scientific debate.”) Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly instructed pregnant women to “tough it out.” Sowing doubts regarding vaccines, going all in on fringe theories, and opting for extreme positions instead of embracing nuance: At MAHA’s big reveal, Trump seemed determined to steal Kennedy’s spotlight."" https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/09/trump-autism-tylenol-vaccine-maha/684310/",15.0,15.0,0.0,post,2025-09-23 10:33:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticdiscussions/comments/1nodtnk/trump_tells_pregnant_women_to_fight_like_hell_not/,/r/atlanticdiscussions/comments/1nodtnk/trump_tells_pregnant_women_to_fight_like_hell_not/,self.atlanticdiscussions,58.0,,30.0

1nnhibz,AutisticPride,theautisticcoach,"Blaming Tylenol, vaccines, or anything else for autism is just eugenics. I keep seeing debates about whether autism is “caused” by Tylenol, vaccines, or whatever new scapegoat people invent. Autism isn’t caused by anything. It’s a natural human neurotype. We’ve always been here and we always will. The whole search for a “cause” is really a search for blame. And blame only makes sense if you think being autistic is bad. That is ableism. It is also the logic of eugenics. Trump, RFK Jr., and others frame autism as a crisis. They talk about us as a problem to prevent, a mistake to eliminate. That is not neutral policy talk. That is eugenics. Disabled people are always the first to be targeted when society starts talking about prevention and reduction. Autistic people are usually first in line because our society is fundamentally autistiphobic. And we can’t ignore the economic angle. Capitalism only values bodies that can be exploited for labor. Disabled people are seen as a drain on the system. Autistic people who can’t or won’t conform to capitalist productivity norms are cast as disposable. When politicians talk about the “costs” of autism, they are telling you whose lives they think aren’t worth living. Liberals who argue about the “real cause” are not defending us either. They are reinforcing the same framework. If you debate causes, you are already accepting that autism is something to fix. That is complicity in ableist and capitalist narratives that mark us as broken. Autistic liberation means rejecting this whole framework. It means refusing to see ourselves as mistakes or burdens. It means fighting for a world where our lives, our needs, and our ways of being are not only accepted but valued. Autistic humans are not broken. We are not a crisis. We are not a burden. We are human. And autistic liberation is bound up with disability justice, with dismantling ableism and capitalism, with refusing every form of eugenics.",192.0,192.0,0.0,post,2025-09-22 09:07:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticPride/comments/1nnhibz/blaming_tylenol_vaccines_or_anything_else_for/,/r/AutisticPride/comments/1nnhibz/blaming_tylenol_vaccines_or_anything_else_for/,self.AutisticPride,27.0,,384.0

1nsqhbi,Defeat_Project_2025,Odd-Alternative9372,"Trump’s comments on autism evoke anger and hope among autistic people and their families. An Indiana woman with an autistic son says President Donald Trump was blaming moms when he made unfounded claims that taking Tylenol while pregnant causes autism. - A Kentucky woman diagnosed with the condition as an adult thought Trump was villainizing autism by describing it as a “horrible, horrible crisis.” - A Massachusetts man whose twin boys have profound autism found the Republican president’s words hopeful because it was the first time the father had seen autism discussed at the highest levels of government. - Recent comments about autism by the Republican president and others in his administration are rippling through the United States, stirring up a wide range of views and feelings among autistic people and their families. Some welcome the renewed focus and pledges of research money for the complex developmental condition. Others are outraged by what they consider the blaming, shaming and spreading claims not grounded in science. - On Monday, Trump repeatedly warned pregnant women not to take Tylenol, known by the generic name acetaminophen, and he fueled discredited claims about autism and vaccines. Some studies have raised the possibility that taking acetaminophen in pregnancy might be associated with a risk of autism. Many others, however, have not found a connection and no causal link has been proved. - Meantime, scientists stress that concerns that vaccines could be linked to autism have been long debunked. A fraudulent study claiming a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was later retracted by the journal that published it. Science has shown autism is mostly rooted in genetics. - Dr. Noa Sterling, an OB-GYN, said Trump’s comments, particularly about Tylenol, touched a nerve for many parents of young autistic children. - “There’s this kind of narrative that you have to be careful of absolutely everything you do in pregnancy, and if you eat the wrong thing or do the wrong thing, you’re going to irreparably harm your baby,” she said. “So the Tylenol just plays directly into this fear that, ‘I’ve taken something that has caused this condition in my child.’” - Dani Derner, who has a 4-year-old autistic son, said it is “really disappointing” that women are being blamed. - “I personally did not take Tylenol during my pregnancy,” said Derner, of Dripping Springs, Texas. But, she said, “some women might not have a choice.” - Some women said the blaming was reminiscent of the disproven mid-20th century theory that emotionally cold “refrigerator mothers” caused autism. - “When I heard that he said acetaminophen was the cause, I was a little scared and a little sad because as a mom of a child with autism, I felt like maybe I was being blamed for that,” said Rachel Deaton of Fishers, Indiana, who has a 22-year-old autistic son. “We really don’t know what causes autism.” - Kelly Sue Milano of Fullerton, California, who has an autistic son, added: “A lot of responsibility and at times criticism is placed on mothers, I think, in a really unbalanced and unfair way.” - Some autistic people recoiled at the notion that autism is something to cure. - “It is part of who we are,” said Dani Bowman, CEO of DaniMation Entertainment and a cast member of “Love on the Spectrum.” “My mom never took Tylenol while she was pregnant with me or my sister. My dad has autism. My sister has autism. I have autism.” - Katy Thurman, a legal assistant in Lexington, Kentucky, who was diagnosed with autism as an adult, grew angry at the concept of eradicating autism. - “There are actual crises going on in this country. People being autistic is not one of them,” Thurman said. - Others were encouraged by the attention on the developmental disorder. - “We need a voice at the table and we have to do something,” said Matt Murphy of Ayer, Massachusetts, who has twin 8-year-old boys with profound autism. “That’s the hopeful thing I take out of this -– finally, the top level of government is talking about this.” - He said people with profound autism will need lifetime support, and federal and state governments will need to take action in many areas, including education and housing. Murphy is glad to see federal money going toward research into autism’s causes. - “Even if you find the cause … we still have the current population that we need to support and address and help,” he said. - Deaton, who has an adult autistic son, agrees, but worries about federal cuts affecting things such as Medicaid and special education. Those help autistic people contribute to society, get jobs and be taxpayers, she said. - Judith Ursitti leads the Profound Autism Alliance and was among a group of people who met with the director of the National Institutes of Health in June. She said hearing the term “profound autism” in a White House event was validating and she was pleased with the list of research being funded. - But Ursitti, mother of a 22-year-old son with autism, realizes that people on other parts of the autism spectrum found some of the language hurtful and that others in her community were outraged because they believe moms were being blamed. - Ursitti also said some of the discussion was confusing, including the failure to tease out profound autism from other parts of the spectrum when mentioning the statistic that 1 in about 31 children is affected by autism spectrum disorder in the U.S. - “The vast majority of people with autism don’t fall into that profound category,” she said. - She said reactions to comments made at the White House were in some ways as diverse as the autism community itself. - “There’s a divide that’s quite similar to what we’re seeing in our country, honestly,” she said.",249.0,249.0,0.0,post,2025-09-28 14:59:23,https://apnews.com/article/autism-trump-pregnancy-tylenol-65e9c04d05014345364212ecaec4ee3e,/r/Defeat_Project_2025/comments/1nsqhbi/trumps_comments_on_autism_evoke_anger_and_hope/,apnews.com,18.0,,498.0

1no0chx,conspiracy,jurornumber1,"'Amish have no autism,' claims Trump as he links Tylenol to the condition | News UK Video News. In his press conference today, President Donald Trump made the remarkable claim that Autism is directly related to supplements and pharmaceuticals, and that in Amish communities the rate of autism is ""virtually zero - i heard none"" before fact-checking himself. The quote (starting at 1:40 in the video): DJT : ""There are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines, and don't take any pills, that have no autism ... that have no autism ... does that tell you something? Is that a correct statement by the way? (turning to RFK Jr.) RFK Jr: "" There are some studies that suggest, with the Amish for example - "" (gets cut off) DJT: ""The Amish... Virtually, i heard none. See Bobby wants to be very careful with what he says, and he should, but i'm not so careful with what i say. But you have certain groups, the Amish for example, they have essentially no Autism."" So the president just openly admits, in a press conference that they've found the cure for autism, that he doesn't know, and in fact does not care, whether the statements he is making are true.

Research doesn’t show using Tylenol during pregnancy causes autism. After years of research, no study has shown that acetaminophen, the main ingredient in Tylenol, causes autism. There's no known single cause of autism, a neurological condition that influences how someone acts and communicates. But some scientific terms, like ""association,"" can confuse the issue. There's some research that says there's an association between taking acetaminophen during pregnancy and autism. There's also some research that says there's not an association. But either way, there's an important caveat: ""Association"" is not the same as causation.

1npjcco,TrueUnpopularOpinion,SuccessfulCompany294,"Tylenol in their own words. Many people are wrong about this latest Tylenol controversy who say its totally safe for pregnant women. This post has nothing to do with the autism claims which is why this subject is even news, but I will post the two studies and you can read them for yourself. I do not and am not making any claim that Tylenol causes autism. This will be be about the claim that Tylenol is safe for pregnant women. Tylenol in 2017 said they do not recommend taking ANY of their products during pregnancy. This isn’t a conspiracy against Tylenol it’s their own recommendation. Now everyone is coming out saying it’s safe for pregnancy. What an odd coincidence I wonder what changed? Did someone say something that people didn’t like? Tylenol has NEVER actually conducted studies on their own drug to see if it IS safe for pregnant women. They have only RECENTLY in the last day said they have a study, but have not posted ANY proof of it. Previously people were saying there is no study cause its not safe to conduct it on pregnant women. Mind you, Pregnant women are advised to stay away from almost every pharmaceutical drug, listen to any pharmaceutical commercial, you will hear them say ""Do not take if you are pregnant or trying to be."" So how is there an ethical study now, that previously has never been released and does this study exist today one day after this news broke, when it didn't exist last week. Who conducted an ethical study on pregnant women and how was it conducted. ZERO PROOF Offered, all talk zero evidence, and if you THINK there is proof, post it here. Anyone here, now or in the future saying its safe for pregnant women to take drugs prescription or not is lying to you, every Pharma commercial literally tells you not to. Just listen to any of them on TV every other commercial. So whats easier, put it on the market and make it OTC, so anyone can buy it and just say ""ask your doctor."" What study does your doctor have to go off of? Let me guess millions of people rush to their doctor for recommendations about OTC meds, lmfao. Tylenol took the easy way out. Trump has somehow managed to make the anti big pharma be totally in the pocket of big pharma, imagine that. There are people in this very thread trying to now claim that just because Tylenol says they recommend you not take it while pregnant is them saying they are not actually telling you to not take it. Read that twice, then read through this thread. However now, just a few years later after Tylenol said they do not recommend pregnant women take this drug, people want you taking it. https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/09/acog-affirms-safety-benefits-acetaminophen-pregnancy In 2013 Reuters Health published this. https://www.reuters.com/article/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/too-much-tylenol-in-pregnancy-could-affect-development-idUSBRE9AL15M/ Too much Tylenol in pregnancy could affect development By Kathryn Doyle November 22, 2013 NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Expectant mothers often take Tylenol, with the active ingredient acetaminophen, to deal with back pain, headaches or mild fevers during pregnancy. But frequent use may be linked to poorer language skills and behavior problems among their children, according to a new study. As the most popular over-the-counter drug in the U.S., Tylenol has been extensively studied in relation to premature birth and miscarriage, with no connections found. But its maker Johnson & Johnson periodically comes under fire for the drug's small therapeutic index - that is, the difference between an effective dose and a dangerous dose is quite small. So interest in investigating the drug persists. The new study is the first to look at young children whose mothers took Tylenol while pregnant. ""Our findings suggest that (acetaminophen) might not be as harmless as we think,"" Ragnhild Eek Brandlistuen said. She led the study at the School of Pharmacy at the University of Oslo in Norway. She and her coauthors studied 48,000 Norwegian children whose mothers answered survey questions about their medication use at weeks 17 and 30 of pregnancy, and again six months after giving birth. Mothers filled out a follow-up questionnaire about their child's developmental milestones three years later. Close to four percent of women took Tylenol for at least 28 days total during pregnancy. Their children seemed to have poorer motor skills than kids whose mothers had taken the drug fewer times or not at all. Tylenol-exposed kids also tended to start walking later, have poorer communication and language skills and more behavior problems. It's difficult to define risks for pregnant women and their children, since rigorous tests and controlled studies of drug exposure aren't ethical, Brandlistuen said. All researchers can do is closely observe women in the real world. But this study, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, involved a large number of women, and researchers also looked for any link to ibuprofen, a pain-relief alternative without acetaminophen. They found no development problems tied to ibuprofen. As far as Autism, there are studies and I don't know the validity of them nor will I make judgement, I will just post them. I dont wish to get into the autism debate, I only wish to address the claims that somehow Tylenol is now somehow safe and there IS an ethical study by Tylenol that didn't exist until Yesterday. Mount Sini Study ""New York, NY (August 13, 2025) Researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in children. The study, published today in BMC Environmental Health, is the first to apply the rigorous Navigation Guide methodology to systematically evaluate the rigor and quality of the scientific literature. Acetaminophen (often sold under the brand name Tylenol®, and known as paracetamol outside the United States and Canada) is the most commonly used over-the-counter pain and fever medication during pregnancy and is used by more than half of pregnant women worldwide. Until now, acetaminophen has been considered the safest option for managing headache, fever, and other pain. Analysis by the Mount Sinai-led team of 46 studies incorporating data from more than 100,000 participants across multiple countries challenges this perception and underscores the need for both caution and further study."" https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/mount-sinai-study-supports-evidence-that-prenatal-acetaminophen-use-may-be-linked-to-increased-risk-of-autism-and-adhd In 2019 JHU Published this study.

1nno59l,TheRaceTo10Million,Thereian,"Trump Autism Announcement Play. Today Trump will have a press conference with RFK announcing a breakthrough in Autism research. The market has focused a lot on Tylenol producers due to news that the conference [will link Tylenol use to Autism](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/21/trump-autism-tylenol-acetaminophen-fever-00574564). However, there’s another bigger play not even on the market radar. This morning the FDA [quietly put out a press release](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2025-18430/approval-of-previously-withdrawn-new-drug-application-wellcovorin-leucovorin-calcium-tablets) that they’re requesting $GSK to resubmit a formally withdrawn drug for approval in Autism. [Here’s a relevant X post](https://x.com/alecgaffney/status/1970110267674771934?s=46&t=uefgJpGogAsXoAtQo_xL2A), text pasted here. “How strange is this? The drug's original manufacturer, GSK, didn't even ask FDA to do this. FDA said it plans to as GSK to submit a supplemental New Drug Application to revise the prescribing information.” So what’s the play? At today’s press conference, I think Trump and RFK will brag about this new found “treatment.” (I have not reviewed the data and have no opinion on the actual drug effectiveness.) Nonetheless, $GSK may rally even a little on the news. The IP of the drug has long expired, but in a new indication they’ll get 3 years exclusivity. The play: weekly calls, $41C. This is highly risky. If nothing gets said in the press conference these are likely a zero. If it does get mentioned or the news picks it up, it could pop a few percent and therefore the calls would go up substantially. I have something close to $65k in calls across 3 accounts.",60.0,60.0,0.0,post,2025-09-22 14:34:19,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nno59l,/r/TheRaceTo10Million/comments/1nno59l/trump_autism_announcement_play/,reddit.com,30.0,,120.0

1noz1ar,TrueUnpopularOpinion,HumbleEngineering315,"The whole Tylenol-autism-pregnancy panic should be a push for decentralized healthcare. Recently, the Trump administration came out and said that [Tylenol was correlated to autism](https://www.youtube.com/live/esKFMCb_hYU?t=266s) in children when taken during pregnancy. The problem being is that the study that the Trump administration cited showed a very weak correlation between Tylenol and autism. The correlation was hardly enough to act on, much less announce a proclamation. And there was a huge conflict of interest by the authors of the study cited.

What this whole situation highlights is what libertarians have been saying all along: government institutions are prone to political capture and agendas, and private organizations are able to advise the public even better than the government can. . It’s not that private institutions are perfect, but at least you can have competing viewpoints, second opinions, and independent research. Doctors, labs, and journals don’t all have to agree. That’s a good thing. It gives people the ability to weigh different sources and make informed decisions for themselves. We don’t need one government approved narrative. Especially when that narrative can shift depending on who’s in office. Decentralized healthcare doesn't mean chaos.

1nov81q,conspiracy,NoResponsibility1728,"Trump says taking Tylenol while Pregnant causes Autism. Why would Trump blame a BRAND NAME, ""Tylenol"" for autism instead of its combination of components? ""Tylenol"" is acetaminophen. There may be differing formulas depending on if you're talking a dry or gel pill, but why blame a brand name instead of a specific formula? My best guess would be that Trump wants to drive down the sale of Tylenol specifically. People in his voter base are not going to buy or use Tylenol regardless of pregnancy status if they believe it causes autism, they might even try to get it taken off of store shelves. They will however, continue to buy and use acetaminophen, because they don't know that Tylenol is just a brand name for it, they'll think Tylenol itself is the autism causing chemical. Knowing this, acetaminophen will still be used but the Tylenol brand and business will suffer financially and even socially.

Last week, President Trump claimed there’s a link between paracetamol (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism. He suggested it was behind the “meteoric rise” in diagnoses and even implied doctors may stop recommending the medication. These statements have been widely debunked by doctors, health officials, and medical researchers. A large 2024 Swedish study of 2.4 million children found [no evidence to support this claim](https://news.ki.se/no-link-between-paracetamol-use-during-pregnancy-and-autism-or-adhd-in-children). Experts stress that correlation is not causation, and misinformation like this undermines decades of peer-reviewed science. Autistic voices have spoken out, warning that Trump’s comments risk shifting the narrative from supporting autistic people to trying to “eradicate” autism. [The National Autistic Society](https://www.autism.org.uk/what-we-do/news/thousands-join-fight-against-president-trumps) branded Trump’s claims “dangerous, anti-science, and irresponsible,” saying such rhetoric devalues autistic people.

Huh? So now we've been forced to take Tylenol? Since when? One theory I've heard regarding autism is that the older you or your spouse is when you have a child, the higher the risk of having a child with autism or on the spectrum. I hope a doctor explains that to Leavitt since she's married to someone older than her parents. Geez, I hope they don't ban epidurals. I didn't listen to this news conference, but I heard that Trump could not pronounce acetaminophen. Tylenol is a brand name for the over-the-counter pain reliever and fever reducer acetaminophen.

1no1yld,disability,LabelsLie,"Fake News : Autism vs. Tylenol Introduction. Timeline: Autism vs. Tylenol Introduction Donald Triplett’s birth and diagnosis predate the introduction of Tylenol by decades. The over-the-counter Tylenol brand (acetaminophen) was first introduced in 1955 by McNeil Laboratories ￼. By contrast, autism was identified and described in the early 1940s ￼, with Triplett’s case being “Case 1.” In other words, the first known autism patient was born in 1933 – over 20 years before Tylenol even existed on the market. This timeline is crucial for evaluating Trump’s suggestion. If acetaminophen use during pregnancy were the cause of autism, one would not expect clear cases of autism to appear long before Tylenol was available. Yet that is exactly what happened: children were being diagnosed with autism in the 1940s and 1950s well before Tylenol became common. This historical fact undercuts the plausibility of Trump’s insinuation that Tylenol is the root cause of autism. Autism’s prevalence has indeed risen in recent decades, but researchers largely attribute this rise to expanded diagnostic criteria and awareness, rather than a new exposure in the environment ￼. In short, autism existed independently of Tylenol, so it cannot be solely explained by the introduction of that drug.",105.0,105.0,0.0,post,2025-09-22 23:29:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1no1yld/fake_news_autism_vs_tylenol_introduction/,/r/disability/comments/1no1yld/fake_news_autism_vs_tylenol_introduction/,self.disability,13.0,,210.0

1npd8bf,Defeat_Project_2025,Odd-Alternative9372,"3 thoughts from an autism researcher on Trump's acetaminophen and vaccine claims. President Trump's suggestion that a link exists between autism and acetaminophen — the active ingredient in Tylenol — has raised concerns within the scientific community. - Trump, along with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid chief Dr. Mehmet Oz, said Monday that autism rates are up because pregnant women are taking the medicine that is often used to treat pain and fever. - ""Taking Tylenol is not good,"" Trump said during an announcement in which he also discouraged giving the medicine to young children. Tylenol's maker, Kenvue, told NPR in a statement that ""independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents."" - Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence (CARE) at Boston University and founder of the Coalition of Autism Scientists, called the administration's announcement ""appalling."" She said it was ""a very significant distortion"" of what science says about any possible links between acetaminophen and autism. - The message ""is likely to impact millions of lives of pregnant women right now. Mothers of autistic children who are going to be so fearful that this is what they did to cause their child's autism, which is absolutely not the case,"" Tager-Flusberg said. - Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Tager-Flusberg, who has studied autism for decades, responded to claims Trump made about autism, acetaminophen and vaccines, and the FDA's move to label leucovorin as a treatment option for autism. - At the White House Monday, Trump said pregnant patients should ""fight like hell not to take [acetaminophen]."" He continued saying: ""There may be a point where you have to and that – you'll have to work out with yourself. So don't take Tylenol."" - A study released in August by Harvard University found that women who said they took acetaminophen while pregnant seemed more likely to have a child diagnosed with autism. Ann Bauer, an epidemiologist who worked on that study, told NPR she worried it was too soon for the federal government to offer guidance and that the research community needed to see more evidence. - Tager-Flusberg said that if there is an association between acetaminophen and autism, it is ""small"" and ""limited"" and ""interacts most likely with the genetics, which is the main contribution to what causes autism."" - She added, ""There's absolutely no evidence out there to support the kind of strong statement that we heard from President Trump."" - Tager-Flusberg said the combination MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella) — which Trump also took aim at Monday — is ""perfectly safe"" and that research has completely debunked any links between it and autism. Study after study have found no link between autism and the vaccine, which is typically administered to children after their first birthday and again between ages 4 and 6, according to the CDC. - On Monday, Trump suggested splitting the MMR vaccine's administration into multiple visits. - ""Don't let them pump your baby up with the largest pile of stuff you've ever seen in your life, going into the delicate little body of a baby, even if it's two years, three years, four years, you just break it up into, I would say five, but let's say four, four visits to the doctor instead of one."" - Tager-Flusberg said Trump raising the concern is ""likely to raise fear among mothers, confusion and chaos for pediatricians."" - ""This is really not what our society needs right now,"" she added. - The Food and Drug Administration also announced Monday that it would label leucovorin, a form of vitamin B typically used along with cancer medicines, as a treatment for speech-related deficits associated with autism. - Tager-Flusberg said that while a ""promising"" small-scale study showed language improvement for a group of children who were administered leucovorin, the treatment has — at best — ""weak evidence in support of it."" - She added that researchers need to build on early studies with a large-scale, randomized controlled trial and that they need to know what outcomes can be expected, dosage levels and which children to observe. - ""We need a study to investigate this right now, far before the FDA … should be approving this medication,"" Tager-Flusberg said. ""They haven't done this for a single other medication in the history of autism.""",140.0,140.0,0.0,post,2025-09-24 14:12:25,https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5550182/trump-vaccines-tylenol-autism-acetaminophen,/r/Defeat_Project_2025/comments/1npd8bf/3_thoughts_from_an_autism_researcher_on_trumps/,npr.org,5.0,,280.0

1nongzn,EmbryologyIVFSupport,embryomanofficial,"Experts push back on Trump warnings about Tylenol in pregnancy and autism. The FDA has added a warning to acetaminophen (paracetamol, Tylenol) about a “possible association” with autism in pregnancy, though scientists stress there’s no evidence it causes autism. President Trump urged the public to avoid the drug entirely, and health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also pointed to vaccines, despite decades of studies showing no link. Their comments leaned on a Harvard and Mount Sinai review of 46 studies, which found some associations with neurodevelopmental disorders but emphasized that causation is unproven. In an interview, lead author Diddier Prada said, “We cannot answer the question about causation — that is very important to clarify.” Pregnant women may take acetaminophen for health problems such as infections or fevers, and those problems — not the drug — might cause the increased risk of developmental disorders. Scientists say the larger, better-controlled studies show no link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism, with any associations being very small and not evidence of causation. A Swedish study of 2.5 million children found no association when controlling for genetics and family health background (in sibling comparisons). “Genetics is the big unobserved elephant in the room,” said senior author Brian Lee. Another large study from Japan with 200,000 children also found no link. Researchers say better studies are needed with stronger data on genetics, dosage, and frequency, and warn that focusing only on acetaminophen oversimplifies autism. They also caution that discouraging its use could take away a safe option for pregnant people and fuel misinformation. ✅ I used two sources for this post: [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02876-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02876-1), [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/health/autism-acetaminophen-tylenol.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/health/autism-acetaminophen-tylenol.html) ✉️ Like this post?

1nn4gqz,,Dr_Nebbiolo,"Current evidence from large population-based studies and meta-analyses has investigated whether acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy is linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. Initial observational studies and meta-analyses reported a modestly increased risk of ASD in children exposed to acetaminophen in utero, with pooled risk ratios around 1.19 (95% CI: 1.14–1.25).[1][2][3] However, these studies are limited by confounding factors, such as maternal health, indication for acetaminophen use, and genetic/environmental influences. The most rigorous recent evidence comes from sibling-controlled analyses, which account for shared familial and environmental confounders. According to a study published in JAMA: This finding indicates that, when controlling for familial confounding, acetaminophen use during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of autism. The absolute risk difference at 10 years was only 0.09% higher in exposed children, a clinically negligible difference.[4] For context, the following figure from the same study illustrates the absolute risk differences for autism, ADHD, and intellectual disability between exposed and unexposed children, both in population-based and sibling-controlled models. It demonstrates that the association disappears when sibling controls are used, supporting the conclusion that prior associations were likely due to confounding. In summary, while earlier observational studies suggested a possible association, the best available evidence using robust sibling-control methodology does not support a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. Clinical guidelines have not changed based on these findings, and acetaminophen remains the recommended first-line analgesic and antipyretic for pregnant individuals when indicated.[5] References 1.

1no1rw5,,FblthpLives,"There have been some initial studies that suggest a link between acetaminophen taken during pregnancy and ADHD and related diagnoses. However, follow-up studies have shown that this correlation vanishes when correcting for familial confounding factors: * Study of 2.5 million children in Sweden – which has excellent public health data – shows that the increase is caused by shared familial factors, including genetics, environment, or a mother's underlying condition that requires acetaminophen. This study is particularly valuable, because it tracks siblings exposed to differing levels of acetaminophen in utero, allowing for excellent control: https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/study-reveals-no-causal-link-between-neurodevelopmental-disorders-acetaminophen-exposure-before-birth * The sibling-controlled study found that the apparent link between long-term acetaminophen use and ADHD vanished once familial confounding was accounted for. Families with a higher risk for ADHD are also more likely to use acetaminophen for longer durations, which reverses the causality: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11004836/ * National Institutes of Health funded research confirms that the relationship is due to other underlying factors: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39637384/ Familial confounders are shared genetic or environmental risk factors within a family that create a misleading association between an exposure (e.g., acetaminophen consumption during pregnancy) and an outcome (e.g., neurodevelopmental disorder). These factors, which are shared by family members, influence both the independent variable and the dependent variables, which can lead to studies incorrectly concluding that a causal relationship exist, when in fact it is the shared familial factor that drives the association. This is why the final and key step in the scientific method is ""iterate"" (aka ""retest""). If a study tests the theorized prediction, scientists iterate again and again until they converge on consensus.

1no1rw5,,sl1des_1nto_dms,"i think the change in increased diagnosis is more societal. We seem to turn on and prey on people easier, people aren't as accepting. Even though we preach about multiculturalism and the like, we are not very forgiving when it comes to complications of the mind. the comparison to amish is a good one, they are closely knit, they look after each other well, and we sadly do not. Competitiveness, capitalism and large cities encouraging more psychopath like mentalities and qualities that are self focused and selfishness is encouraged. You are shown little compassion really from society as a whole as it is actually built to be that way, to devour the 'weak' and 'less fortunate'. The amish do not have such things as their way of life is totally different, i would say they may even have high rates of autism really, but becasue it is just accepted as so and alot of the negative stimulus that may trigger at autistic person are not present in everyday amish life. OR maybe the amish just shun anyone who doesn't fit in and thus they are no longer a part of that group, maybe it is LESS compassionate than our way of living. having autism and adhd myself, i can't help but feel like people are always looking to find your weak spots, and those are good ones to use to hurt you with! so societally we will push people to get diagnosed, on the face of it making it out to be that we are just trying to help them, when really when are trying to frame them as a lesser human being and that they are superior to you. at least that's my take on things, my life has not been good since diagnosis, everyone just makes it all out to be false and that i am a liar becasue i 'don't seem like i have autism or adhd'. so hopefully that explains a little of what i have said.",5.0,5.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 07:02:13,,/r/autism/comments/1no1rw5/us_fact_checking_trump_and_rfks_remarks_on_the/nfq8i5s/,,,nfq8i5s,10.0
1no1rw5,,ConsensusAdvisor,"On the Tylenol stuff — the claim that acetaminophen use in pregnancy *causes* autism is not supported by the best evidence. The studies that set this off are mostly **observational and self-reported**, meaning moms were asked years later how often they took Tylenol. That’s prone to recall bias and confounding (fever itself, genetics, and other health issues could explain the risk). A couple of the big ones people cite: * **Ji et al., JAMA Psychiatry 2019** – cord blood metabolites linked to higher odds of ASD/ADHD. Observational only. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.3259](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.3259) * **Alemany et al., Eur J Epidemiol 2021** – pooled 6 European cohorts, found small ↑ risk for autism/ADHD *symptoms*. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-021-00754-4](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-021-00754-4) * **Masarwa et al., Am J Epidemiol 2018** – systematic review/meta-analysis, small associations. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwy086](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwy086) But the **largest and most rigorous work** tells a different story: * **Ahlqvist et al., JAMA 2024** – Swedish nationwide cohort of 2.4M kids, with sibling-comparison (controls for genetics/family). Found *no association* between prenatal Tylenol use and autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.3172](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.3172) * **Damkier et al., Obstetrics & Gynecology 2024** – review by perinatal pharmacology experts, concluded small associations in some studies are likely due to confounding. DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000005802](https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000005802) That’s also why **ACOG** and the **FDA** still recommend acetaminophen as the preferred pain/fever option during pregnancy when used at the lowest effective dose — because untreated fever can be dangerous for both mother and baby. FWIW, the review Trump cited was co-authored by Andrea Baccarelli, who has been a paid expert witness in Tylenol lawsuits. That doesn’t automatically make the work invalid, but it’s a clear conflict of interest. A federal judge even excluded his testimony in court last year for being “scientifically unsound.” Here’s the search I used to pull up these papers — if anyone wanted to filter by journal rank, study type, or country if you want to dig deeper: [https://consensus.app/search/does-taking-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-cause-a/Eb5HUWEfTrebEQmBJXKsvA/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=clipboard](https://consensus.app/search/does-taking-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-cause-a/Eb5HUWEfTrebEQmBJXKsvA/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=clipboard)",6.0,6.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 16:41:26,,/r/autism/comments/1no1rw5/us_fact_checking_trump_and_rfks_remarks_on_the/nfsltr3/,,,nfsltr3,12.0

1no1rw5,,Thatwierdhullcityfan,"Oh my god, Trump and RFK is actually the biggest idiot going. Autism is not an epidemic, just like left handedness weren’t when people finally figured out that maybe you shouldn’t beat children for using their left hand. Left handedness shot up from 2% to 12% and since then it’s stabilised to around 12%. This is what will happen/is happening with autism, it’s shooting up as more and more people are becoming aware, and getting diagnoses, at some point soon, it will stabilise at whatever number. Autism isn’t an epidemic. That also implies that autistic people are in some way diseased, or a problem, I’ve got thick enough skin to see through Trump’s bullshit, but like if someone’s feeling vulnerable about being autistic, imagine how that makes them feel. (ps if you’re reading this (and you are not Trump, RFK or any of their pedophile buddies) you are not a disease, you are not in any way inferior) Also, I know this is entirely anecdotal, but hey if the leader of the “free world” can make entirely batshit claims, so can I, my mother didn’t take acetaminophen and I’m definitely autistic so either I’ve been faking autism since 6 months old (diagnosed at 4), or Trumps a lying rapist. I think it’s the latter. As for the Amish claim this is what riles me up the most. Of course a community that doesn’t believe in, or use, doctors, won’t get a diagnosis for autism, nor will they use medications. Not getting a diagnosis doesn’t magically make someone not autistic, it makes someone an undiagnosed autistic. Autistic people have been around for as long as people themselves. Autism is not a “new thing”. It isn’t a “trend” or an “epidemic”, it is a name for a condition that has always existed. RFK is a (literal) worm brained idiot. I don’t suffer from autism, it’s society and cunts like these that make me suffer. Also, either that is a stat pulled out of thin air, or those people are idiots too. Vaccines don’t cause autism, how many more fucking studies do we need? How much more evidence do we need to give the cunt before his worm brain and gravel sounding stupid little voice that really fucking grinds my gears before he finally says that vaccines don’t fucking cause autism.

1no1rw5,,IAmWeary,"Trumpy and RFK are human dogshit, but there may actually be something to leucoverin. It's just folinic acid, aka calcium folinate. They're probably being very sloppy by using ""cerebral folate deficiency"", because it's tied to the blocking and/or binding folate receptor antibodies, which about 50% of folks on the spectrum have. Those antibodies make it difficult for folate to get through the blood-brain barrier. This doesn't necessarily mean the affected person will have cerebral folate deficiency (which is a specific metric), but they very likely have less folate in the CNS than average. Apparently folinic acid is the best form to try and get around this, so blasting the system with it can help get more folate into the CNS and alleviate the issue. However, it is true that this is still relatively young research and we shouldn't just be blasting little kids with megadoses of folate without knowing what the longer-term effects of it could be. And IIRC, production of the antibody may be tied to the bovine folate binding protein, which is present in a lot of dairy. Cutting dairy out of the diet may improve symptoms by reducing production of the antibody, which might be why the fad casein-free diets may have inadvertently been somewhat effective on some people. Again, this is still a pretty young vein of research, so don't assume that anything is gospel.",2.0,2.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 17:57:40,,/r/autism/comments/1no1rw5/us_fact_checking_trump_and_rfks_remarks_on_the/nft29b0/,,,nft29b0,4.0

However, analyses of matched full sibling pairs found no evidence of increased risk of autism (hazard ratio, 0.98), ADHD (hazard ratio, 0.98), or intellectual disability (hazard ratio, 1.01) associated with acetaminophen use. —— The study found a **casual link** between neurodevelopmental disorders.

They scored the exposure in ASD studies to be biased. The worst scored categories were: ""3. Were exposure assessment methods lacking accuracy?"" ""5. Was potential confounding inadequately incorporated?"" 8 studies were analyzed. (Scoring: 1 - low risk of bias; 2 - probably low risk of bias; 3 - probably high risk of bias; 4 - high risk of bias) 3:3 4s, 4 2s, and only one 1 5:2 4s, one 3, one 2, and 4 1s Confounding was a little better evaluated.

1no1rw5,,catboyslum,">NEW: The medication is currently sold by Dr. Mehmet Oz’s supplement company iHerb; Dr. Oz holds a government position, overseeing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and attended the press conference. >By participating in the announcement and promoting leucovorin as a potential autism treatment, Dr. Oz is using his public platform as a government official to advocate for a product that is directly related to the industry in which he has a major financial stake. The official endorsement of a drug for a specific use, especially with the promise of potential Medicaid coverage, can create a massive demand and boost sales. The fact that this drug is related to vitamin B9, a common supplement, could drive consumers to buy similar products from companies like iHerb. In his role at CMS, Dr. Oz has the authority to make decisions about the coverage of treatments and supplements under Medicare and Medicaid. This creates a direct link between his financial interests and his government duties. Public records show that Dr. Oz had not fully divested his financial holdings in iHerb before taking his government position. While he has said he would not participate in matters that directly affect his financial interests, his presence and role in the press conference raise significant ethical questions about whether he is using his position for personal gain. u/WindermerePeaks1, this has been debunked. Dr. Oz divested his stake in iHerb. Moreover, Leucovorin, the prescription form of folinic acid, cannot be bought without a prescription and iHerb doesn't sell prescription drugs.

1no1rw5,,Senior-Pin-3386,"Most of these sources are not unbiased reports or research. I highly recommend taking a look at VAERS website. Vaccines indeed have increased in dosage and frequency over the last 40 years. Read The GAPS Diet book by Dr. Natasha Campbell Bride. Multiple things “cause autism” but you have to have the gene to create the catalyst for the harmful side effects that coincide with that. (Epigenetics plays a huge roll in this- read Dirty Genes by Ben Lynch) Also, Dr. Andrew Wakefield has done some excellent research on the MMR vaccine. He doesn’t recommend it as a single vaccine but should be split into 3, if taken. This combo shot has caused autism like issues, which is reported on VAERS. Some of this is common sense and we need to think more logically about some of these things. Dr. Don’t need to give a Hep B shot to mothers in delivery UNLESS the test positive for it, which they do at the hospital. Also keep in mind to read the warning/caution labels on vaccines and acetaminophen or Tylenol. Reversing vaccine damage and environmental causes takes time. A vitamin B shot or treatment won’t be a be all end all. Detoxing protocols, changing the diet, drinking water without the chemicals infused in it, supplementing the lack in nutrients, and therapy all can and do help those who seek to reverse damage done to those who have autism/adhd. I am one who is living proof and there are countless others. There is hope, we have to do things differently and it’s not a partisan issue. The health of this country sucks and we have to change.

A few studies said maybe there was. Most have said no correlation. A study with 2.5 MILLION people in it over the course of 26 YEARS said there was no correlation. The recognition and diagnosis of autism is what has gone up. I don't think the true incidence of autism is higher now than 30+ years ago. 50 years ago when someone was mildly autistic people brushed it off and just said ""oh that's Jimmy he's kinda odd but a nice fellah"".

1nnyh26,,According_To_Me,"I hate to type this phrasing, but as an adult woman that was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder when I was 2, and who just finished having an argument with my husband about this topic, this is ridiculous on so many levels I could type it in this post for the rest of the night. My mom noticed something was wrong/different/ concerning when I was 2, had hit all the usual milestones, and then one day I completely stopped talking. Mute. Speechless. I was diagnosed not long after. I didn’t find out until I was in 8th grade, after *countless* social trial and errors. As I got older, I struggled with my parents expectations of me career-wise, socializing, name it. I have taught adults with autism in a vocational program that I won’t reveal here for privacy reasons. It’s a spectrum, there are severe cases that will need assistance for the rest of their life, and there are some like me who have “a touch of the brush” but still struggle with certain aspects of life. But for some fucking reason, all I’ve heard/interpreted in my 35+ years of personal experiences is that ASD is something that some people want to be *gone*. They focus on the most severe cases, and then lump in anyone who’d be described as “high functioning” into the same group. I even worked at a large corporation that claimed to be inclusive and paid lip service for Autism Awareness month, but the moment I brought up my diagnosis, I noticed I was treated differently. Like I might have a temper tantrum at the drop of a hat. Treating me like a toddler. Thinking I’m stupid despite my long list of accomplishments. Losing out on job opportunities. It sucks that as a whole, society thinks ASD is a “problem” that needs to be “fixed.” So whenever anyone brings up that they’ve found the link, and then go about it in a way that sounds like “if we get rid of XYZ, we’ll get rid of autism,” I’m against it.

1nn231s,,justhereforfighting,"[Ahlqvist et al 2024](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406) found that there was an association between different NSAID and non-NSAID pain relievers and ASD/ADHD/other intellectual disabilities, but that effect disappeared or even had a protective effect in a sibling analysis. This was a robust study with more than 2.4 million samples collected, more than 180,000 of which had exposure to acetaminophen during pregnancy, more than 1.7 million siblings from 780,000 families, and recorded no acetaminophen use during pregnancy, any use, and daily use (stratified based on daily dosage). Here is a snippet: >...for autism, compared with no use of acetaminophen, persons with low (<25th percentile), medium (25th-75th percentile), and high (>75th percentile) mean daily acetaminophen use had \[hazard ratios\] of 0.85, 0.96, and 0.88, respectively \[in the siblings analysis\]. They conclude: >Sibling control analyses found no evidence that acetaminophen use during pregnancy was associated with children’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability. This suggests that the small increase in children’s risk of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with acetaminophen use observed in statistical models without sibling control may have been due to unmeasured confounding. In addition, sibling control analyses did not identify a dose-response association between acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders. I don't see how they can point to a single study with a total of 108 participants with ASD and say there is really much evidence of all to link ASD to acetaminophen usage during pregnancy. But they said they were going to find the link by September, so they had to come up with something. They pointed to a 4 year old study and said ""it was right under our nose all along,"" and ignored all the follow up studies that showed no link with far greater sample sizes.",2.0,2.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 02:13:26,,/r/medicine/comments/1nn231s/trump_administration_set_to_tie/nfpb5n7/,,,nfpb5n7,4.0

1no095s,,Mobile-Fox-8900,"UK Reporting : Doctors in the US will soon be advised not to prescribe the pain reliever Tylenol to pregnant women, US President Donald Trump said, citing a disputed link between the drug and autism. The US president claimed on Monday that taking Tylenol, known as paracetamol elsewhere, ""is no good"" and that pregnant women should ""fight like hell"" to only take it in cases of extreme fever. Medical experts have strongly pushed back on the claims, with some calling the president's comments dangerous. Health officials in the UK have stressed that paracetamol remains the safest painkiller available to pregnant women. Dr Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement that Monday's announcement ""is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children"". The leading medical professional group said doctors across the country have consistently identified Tylenol as one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women. ""Studies that have been conducted in the past, show no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during any trimester and fetal developmental issues,"" the group has said. The drug is recommended by other major medical groups as well as other governments around the world. Tylenol is a popular brand of pain relief medication sold in the US, Canada and some other countries. Its active ingredient is acetaminophen, better known as paracetamol outside of North America. In a statement to the BBC, Tylenol maker Kenvue said the science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. ""We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers."" Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, it added, and without it, women face a dangerous choice between suffering through conditions like fever or using riskier alternatives. Trump made the announcement in the Oval Office alongside Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr who said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will issue a physicians notice about what he described as the potential risk of taking Tylenol during pregnancy. He said the FDA will also begin the process of initiating a safety label change on the medication and launch a public health campaign to spread awareness. Kennedy added that the FDA will soon approve leucovorin, a decades-old drug traditionally used to protect cancer patients against toxicity from chemotherapy, to be used as treatment for children with autism. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the approval will be based on research that he said suggests the drug may help children with autism who are deficient in folate, a form of vitamin B, improve their verbal communication. But researchers have cautioned that the science is still in the very early stages, and more work is needed before any firm conclusions can be reached. The Autism Science Foundation, a US charity, said low folate levels during early pregnancy have been linked in some studies to an increased risk of autism in children, though the findings are not consistent. Studies in Norway, the US and Israel found that mothers who took folic acid supplements around conception had children with a 30-70% lower likelihood of autism. But other studies did not find a significant association. The charity said the suggestion folate may improve some symptoms comes from trials of leucovorin, also known as folinic acid. Some research has shown that unlike regular folic acid, folinic acid can more easily cross the blood brain barrier and address a deficiency of the vitamin. Four small, randomised trials, all using different doses and measurements of success, have been carried out. One, from 2016, studied 48 autistic children in the US and found improvements in verbal communication compared with a placebo. In April, Kennedy pledged ""a massive testing and research effort"" to determine the cause of autism in five months. Trump on Monday called the rise in reported autism cases a ""horrible crisis"", and an issue that he has ""very strong feelings about"". But experts have cautioned that finding the causes of autism - a complex syndrome that has been researched for decades - would not be simple. The widely held view of researchers is that there is no single cause of autism, which is thought to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors. In August, a review of research, external led by the dean of Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health found that children may be more likely to develop autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders when exposed to Tylenol during pregnancy. Researchers argued some steps should be taken to limit use of the drug, but said it was still important for treating maternal fever and pain, which can also have negative effects for children. But another study, published in 2024,, external found no relationship between exposure to Tylenol and autism. It was conducted by looking at a population sample of 2.4 million children born in Sweden between 1995 to 2019. Around 7.5% of them were exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy. By comparing autism rates between those exposed versus those who were not, as well as comparing siblings who shared genetics, the study concluded that there was no increased risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability that can be definitively linked to acetaminophen. ""There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship,"" said Monique Botha, a professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University. Dr Botha added that pain relief for pregnant women was ""woefully lacking"", with Tylenol being one of the only safe options for the population. Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, and by 2020 the rate among 8-year-olds reached 2.77%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Scientists attribute at least part of the rise to increased awareness of autism and an expanding definition of the disorder. Researchers have also been investigating environmental factors. In the past, Kennedy has offered debunked theories about the rising rates of autism, blaming vaccines despite a lack of evidence.",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 07:37:28,,/r/AskUS/comments/1no095s/trump_autism_lets_discuss/nfqbmsk/,,,nfqbmsk,2.0

1no3mat,,immersive-matthew,"Dr. Seheult on YouTube who sells nothing, just did a video on this and carefully laid out the data to basically say sure, it is a potential factor out of many. Blaming it solely on acetaminophen as THE cause is utterly misleading as eliminating it likely will have near zero impact given the thousands of other oxidative stressors in our environment. Avoiding it is not the silver bullet. Dr. Seheult does share that there are things pregnant women can do to help minimize the odds of their baby developing autism which avoiding acetaminophen is just one of and perhaps not even the one to really focus on, outside of avoiding as it is an easy win, but not as the only strategy if all other emerging risk factors remain the same. https://youtu.be/SGaQw5HyX38?si=CGAo-xxnaI2Fym7E Hopefully most adults will recognize it is not that simple even if the government does not.",2.0,2.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 08:07:12,,/r/politics/comments/1no3mat/trump_79_struggles_to_say_word_for_tylenol_in_his/nfqe8rt/,,,nfqe8rt,4.0

1nnz9vh,,NoobSalad41,"They could not, because the federal government cannot be sued for defamation. As a general rule, the federal government enjoys sovereign immunity from all lawsuits seeking monetary damages (which defamation is). To the extent the federal government may be sued for money damages, it is only because the government has consented to those lawsuits. It has done so through the [Federal Tort Claims Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Tort_Claims_Act), which [allows](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1346#b): >civil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages…for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred. Notably, however, [28 U.S. Code § 2680](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2680) lists the exceptions to this waiver of sovereign immunity, and explicitly includes both libel and slander. For this reason, no person or entity can sue the federal government for defamation — period. You also can’t try to sue government officials acting in their official capacity to get around this rule — under the [Westfall Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Employees_Liability_Reform_and_Tort_Compensation_Act_of_1988), a federal official sued in their personal capacity for actions taken within the scope of their office may invoke the Westfall Act, and have the United States substituted as a defendant. Once the United States is substituted as a defendant in a defamation case, sovereign immunity kicks in, and the case must be dismissed. **EDIT**: See [this case](https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/20a0293p-06.pdf) dismissing Congresspeople from a defamation case for this reason.",282.0,282.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-22 22:03:16,,/r/law/comments/1nnz9vh/could_johnson_and_johnson_who_holds_the_trademark/nfo99kh/,,,nfo99kh,564.0

People started using it in 1887, That means that the drug has been around for over nearly 140 years. If Tylenol was bad, we would have known about well before 7 generations of people take it. 3 - “Neuro-diverse” isn’t a bad thing. Autism isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It’s only a bad thing in a late-stage capitalistic world. Of course there are extreme cases, as in with every group of people, I know there are non-functioning autism, but most autistic folks can function perfectly well in a society that doesn’t only value people acting like machines to make money. (There is a reason why capitalists generally hate the arts. Its where the ND’s thrive) 4 - My Mother was/is against medications. I hardly had Tylenol in my life growing up.

1np2ooo,,ally1112,"I’m gonna approach this another way. The Tylenol and autism issue is possibly more an indicator of the cause of anti-intellectualism than a symptom of it. As other commenters have posted, several reputable research organizations have found correlational links between autism and Tylenol use. However, despite this, people who want us to acknowledge that we don’t have enough information to say that Tylenol is risk free, are often ridiculed. In medicine you are supposed to find relief that is better than the disease. If we are treating mild pain, a woman should be informed of possible, but uncertain correlations to negative outcomes, that could influence her to stay away. However, while doing so, we must be careful not to scare mothers away from treating severe pain and high fevers. Many people are sick of being told to trust science when it has repeatedly come out that results were covered up or studies were designed to meet a certain outcome. For example, for years we were told not to give women hormone replacement therapy during menopause, but now it transitioning toward a standard practice. We have had numerous medical devices such as cobalt hips and vaginal mesh be approved by the FDA after “conclusive” studies, only to be removed from the market after harming thousands. Edit: For some reason people keep assuming I am anti science or believe how Trump and RFK are handling this issue is appropriate. That is not the case. I believe they are making bold and inaccurate claims on inconclusive evidence. I am simply trying to analyze how we got in this situation, which is the only way to find a way back out. You do not recover from a mass mistrust of science by just telling people to trust the science. You have to recover trust in the institution by finding out why people distrust it (and not just assume it’s because they are dumb).",-17.0,-17.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 05:01:20,,/r/changemyview/comments/1np2ooo/cmv_the_conservative_view_on_tylenol_and_autism/nfwbt0b/,,,nfwbt0b,-34.0

1np2ooo,,Maladal,"So let's try to bring a little nuance to this. The official recommendation from the Health Department was actually pretty tame: [https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-trump-kennedy-autism-initiatives-leucovorin-tylenol-research-2025.html](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-trump-kennedy-autism-initiatives-leucovorin-tylenol-research-2025.html) >The FDA is responding to prior clinical and laboratory studies that suggest a potential association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. FDA also recognizes that there are contrary studies showing no association and that there can be risks for untreated fever in pregnancy, both for the mother and fetus. >Given the conflicting literature and lack of clear causal evidence, HHS wants to encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration when treatment is required. Furthermore, FDA recognizes that acetaminophen is often the only tool for fevers and pain in pregnancy, as other alternatives (e.g., NSAIDs) have well documented adverse effects. FDA is partnering with manufacturers to update labeling and drive new research to safeguard mothers, children, and families. This research is not inaccurate. There are studies that show a correlation between Tylenol usage and autism (though ONLY a correlation to my knowledge). There are also studies showing that autism is more likely when you allow fevers to run unabated in pregnant mothers, which is noted here. The HHS announcement acknowledges both of these things, and its recommendation is merely that pregnant women should be made aware that there may be risks to taking Tylenol while pregnant. More information on that is not a bad thing, so long as it's paired with the knowledge that not taking Tylenol can also be problematic. The actual advice is probably something around--take Tylenol if you have a fever while pregnant but try to avoid taking it regularly if you can. I don't think most people find that problematic. The problem comes when Trump enters the picture. He unabashedly came out and tries to paint Tylenol as a total negative. And that drives these kind of discussions. So I would say Trump's view on Tylenol is silly, but I think many Conservatives would align more to the view that what they really see out of this is simply more information for people to make informed decisions.",154.0,154.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 04:31:00,,/r/changemyview/comments/1np2ooo/cmv_the_conservative_view_on_tylenol_and_autism/nfw81e8/,,,nfw81e8,308.0

Facts of the matter is taking tylenol while pregnant increases at risk of autism by 30%. Just like taking NSAIDs like ibuprofen anytime in your life put you at a 50/50 risk of a heart attack. You can sit on opinionated sites all day arguing your opinion, at the end of the day only the facts matter. If you want to know some facts here some: 2006 Dr. Ralph Baric at UNC created from a cross of SARS(a man-made mRNA coronavirus) and crossed it with mRNA from bat coronavirus. He created 250 variants in 2006. There's a NIH paper on it. Google it. Since 1965 Dr Anthony Fauci has been using coronavirus releases and vaccinations against various illnesses to control the population. With a little research, you'll find that SARS,MERS,COV2,COV19, ETC ALL MAN-MADE all with Fauci in charge. Someone wrote a book. Fact: the current president was bought off by Israel aipac for $300 million and a promise to keep the videos of his depraved sexual activities off the internet. Fact: Elon Musk & Peter Thiel both visited Epstein Island after his release from prison. Fact: Palantir is ran by a man who believes he knows who the antichrist is. Israel Zionists BELIEVE THEY MUST CREATE ARMEGEDDON TO SEE THE COMING OF THEIR MESSIAH. FACT: GOD AND THE DEVIL DO NOT NEED TO EXIST FOR PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THEY CAN END THE WORLD IN PURSUE OF IT. SATAN DOESN'T HAVE TO BE REAL FOR SATANISTS TO BELIEVE IT IS SO AND THEY TAKE YOUR CHILDREN. Fact: the richest people on earth are NEVER NAMED. You have NO IDEA who they are, where they are or the level of wealth they hold. Fact: black rock, vanguard and State Street are the largest investor in literally EVERYTHING, they win if you buy coke or Pepsi, if you buy Starbucks or Folgers, if you buy pizza Hut or Domino's. The largest investor in blackrock are state street and vanguard, in vanguard it's state street and blackrock and in state street its blackrock and vanguard. The companies are worth over $11 trillion. Their money comes from all public employees and most major businesses(especially all the companies they invest in) employees retirement fund! Everything wrong on earth, you pay for or allow.

1np2ooo,,RevolutionaryBug7588,"Eh, decades ago medical professionals recommend the elderly take one aspirin per day. Now, it’s recommended to not do that because the risks far outweigh the benefit ([which wasn’t a benefit to begin with)](https://medschool.ucla.edu/news-article/daily-aspirin-no-longer-recommended-to-prevent-heart) What we do know is that depletion of glutathione is a side effect of using acetaminophen. Acetaminophen is in Tylenol and there’s been some studies on the potential issues that could arise from that depletion. [This study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4753970/) refers to it as a form of malnutrition. It also writes about Paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning being common throughout the world. Often times when that poisoning occurs it, at times, requires a liver transplant. In this article ([posted on the site for the American Diabetes Association](https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/54/1/190/14661/Evidence-for-Accelerated-Rates-of-Glutathione)) Speaks about the depletion of glutathione and the effects of it. It talks about weakened antioxidant defense and oxidative stress. If your body goes through prolonged or severe oxidative stress, it could damage your DNA, proteins and lipids. I think it’s worth looking into a bit more because although it’s marketed and pushed as “safe”, but it can also potentially cause serious medical issues. And that’s not a “conservatives view”, it’s a documented medical fact. Last point. The Covid vaccine was stated as fact that the shot would remain within the injection site, the arm. Well, now we find out that’s not the case. The Covid-19 masking was a fact to lower the risk to infect others…. But that fact has changed. There was a time when science stated as a fact that diseases were caused by bad air, which is no longer the fact. Remember when scientists stated that OxyContin was non-addictive, guess that’s changed as well. It was awhile ago but there was a time when [DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane)](https://youtu.be/gtcXXbuR244?feature=shared) was “safe” until it was banned. Then RoundUp took its place, considered by scientists it was also “safe” well, we know the truth there now as well.

1np2ooo,,AllIHearIsHeeHaw,"Apolitical take here: Everyone should look into two things: Acetaminophen depletion of glutathione Glutathione impacts on Autism (but also pretty much everything) At the very least, maybe you will find the history of people dying from Tylenol for years Acetaminophen toxicity is the 2nd leading cause of liver transplants in the world, and the number one cause of liver failure in the US. The US has 50,000 + emergency room visits from Acetaminophen overdose. It's really crazy to me to see literal doctors and scientists either lie or mislead the public about this. Acetaminophen metabolism creates a toxic byproduct called NAPQI. Glutathione in the liver reacts with the NAPQI instead of the hepatotoxin destroying your liver. But, and nobody will care, you're also probably all glutathione-deficient anyway, so Tylenol is just straight poisoning your livers. Also, acetaminophen crosses the placental barrier, and into a fetus. So now you're introducing hepatotoxins to the fetus in development. This is INSANE. Unfortunately, chronic use or overdose will cause toxicity regardless, because you absolutely just can't metabolize infinite glutathione. Glutathione deficiency itself is associated with higher neurodevelopmental birth issues, autism, cognitive decline, schizophrenia etc., because its vital for mitochondria to not just blow out from oxidative stress. Remember ""mitochondria is the power house of the cell"" ? Imagine you kill all the maintenance workers. This will 100% cause major issues in people.

1np2ooo,,darthmcdarthface,"Firstly, autism is a tragedy. We can surely all agree on that. Reducing autism is a good thing right? Therefore, the Trump administration is doing a good thing by trying to reduce autism in this country. I simply don’t see how you argue otherwise on this. Do you believe that effort is something tragic or positive? Secondly, this announcement didn’t come from nowhere. Let’s ignore the information and studies available to us for a minute. Do you really think there’s some ulterior motive for bashing on Tylenol? What is that motive? Why would they do this? You can’t answer those questions without resorting entirely to fantasy. The simplest answer is usually the right one which is that they want to prevent autism and believe that Tylenol may increase that risk during pregnancy. Thirdly, there are academic studies funded by Harvard and John’s Hopkins that showed there was a link to autism resulting in Harvard’s own dean of their Public Health Medical School coming to the conclusion that women should avoid taking Tylenol if possible during pregnancy. The Trump administration is merely taking that warning and applying it to the label via regulatory avenues. There’s plenty of academic and intellectual thought involved here. Lastly, it’s a warning. It merely recommends against use in this situation. Trump himself even said you should take it if you absolutely needed to. This simply cautions against using it and recommends avoiding use if possible. The medial industry is absolutely loaded with warnings of use for any medical treatment of any kind. This is perfectly routine practice. So with that I’d ask, what is left to be concerned about here? The only difference with what happened here and what happens all the time in the pharma space is that this is related to Trump political goals.",-3.0,-3.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 14:48:01,,/r/changemyview/comments/1np2ooo/cmv_the_conservative_view_on_tylenol_and_autism/nfyfvjk/,,,nfyfvjk,-6.0

The natural effect is that good science is being thrown out with the bad due to massive violations of trust. When something like this Tylenol thing is asserted, people are naturally conditioned to believe it. That’s because they have seen time and time again that companies lie and cover up the harms related to their products in order to protect their revenue streams.

1nnm18d,,Bbrhuft,"A single study isn't definitive. A much higher level evidence are [systematic review and meta analyses](https://libraries.health.usf.edu/c.php?g=1224548&p=8958057), that pool many past studies, weight them by quality and adjust for known risk factors e.g. Fever and Infections. These meta analyses show a correlation and modest increased risk of autism, of just +19%, for Acetaminophen use during pregnancy. That said, past studies are not all consistent, thus it is possible to select and cite studies that support your position, which I think is disegenuous. >We identified 46 studies for inclusion in our analysis. Of these, 27 studies reported positive associations (significant links to NDDs), 9 showed null associations (no significant link), and 4 indicated negative associations (protective effects). Higher-quality studies were more likely to show positive associations. Overall, the majority of the studies reported positive associations of prenatal acetaminophen use with ADHD, ASD, or NDDs in offspring, with risk-of-bias and strength-of-evidence ratings informing the overall synthesis. - Prada et al. (2025). That said, Aetaminophen use during pregnancy appears to be just one factor of many associated with an incresed risk of autism, some associations have a much higher risk. These include older parental age, diabetes during pregnancy, first born (61% increased risk), psychoactive medication during pregnancy (68% increased risk), and in Nordic countries... mothers born abroad, etc. It's unfortunate this recently gained more visibility after it came out the mouth of someone who's a huge idiot, and it is now polarised and politicised. However, there does appear to be a correlation between Acetaminophen use during pregnancy and a small increased risk of autism in pooled studies.

1nnm18d,,RigorousMortality,"I did some light reading on the links between Tylenol, Cerebral Folate Deficiency, and Leucovorin. This was based on the fact that the Trump admin, through RFK Jr. and the FDA is reportedly going to draw a connection between Autism and Tylenol, and are going to promote Leucoverin as a treatment drug for autism. A portion of Autism patients have links to CFD (some studies show 18%, others up to 71%) where the brain is getting lower amounts of Folic acid than the rest of the body. The link seems to be strong, but inconsistent in how pervasive it is among autistic people. At no point did I find any link between CFD and Tylenol use among pregnant women. Luecoverin is a drug typically used to help with chemotherapy drug treatments and side effects, and is folinic acid. Folinic acid and Folic acid are both B Vitamins. So they are somewhat promoting a treatment of leucovorin for CFD, though I don't know the actual scientific basis for this if there is one to treat Autism. Like what age it has it's biggest impact on patients, how long treatment lasts, dosages, etc. Based on this administrations disdain for the scientific community, I doubt studies or trials matter to them on this topic. Prolonged used of B vitamins, at prescription levels, can lead to neurological conditions and nerve damage. So the U.S. will likely see a surge in leucovorin prescriptions being issued, followed by an epidemic of children with neurological issues and nerve damage. My two cents, hope I am wrong.",2.0,2.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-22 17:28:42,,/r/skeptic/comments/1nnm18d/tylenol_has_not_been_shown_to_cause_autism/nfmtlgt/,,,nfmtlgt,4.0

Dr Lee reported receiving personal fees from **Beasley Allen Law Firm**, Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP, and AlphaSights and grants from NIH (1R01NS107607) during the conduct of the study and grants from NIH (1P50HD11142-01, 3 P50HD111142-02S1, 1 R01 NS131433-01), Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, US Department of Defense, and Pennsylvania Department of Health CURE SAP (# 410008574)7 outside the submitted work.

1nnm18d,,toodumbtobeAI,"I take Tylenol because I can’t take NSAIDs. I’m pretty sure I’ve always been autistic though so I didn’t give myself autism by taking Tylenol. My mom talked about how she craved Long John Silver’s when she was pregnant with me, so let’s look into that. She quit smoking while pregnant, my dad was a 30 year old alcoholic and she was 27th. I was the third child she gave birth to. You know, of all the things they could look into, I don’t know how many of what I mentioned have been researched, I do not follow this because the cause isn’t as important to me as how we treat the people who are already born. Suppose we spent more energy accommodating the needs of people who are autistic, and only a smaller portion of that time trying to prevent us from existing. If we are truly concerned about autism, then let us find a way to improve the outcomes of autistic people. Most of us are unemployed and bound to a life of poverty and isolation. Again, I think that is something worth prioritizing over prevent preventing us being born. Suppose they could test for it in the womb, would they support the eugenic cure of abortion?

1nnm18d,,Foreign_Feature3849,"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406 Acetaminophen Use During Pregnancy and Children’s Risk of Autism, ADHD, and Intellectual Disability (2024) Abstract- In this population-based study, models without sibling controls identified marginally increased risks of autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) associated with acetaminophen use during pregnancy. However, analyses of matched full sibling pairs found no evidence of increased risk of autism (hazard ratio, 0.98), ADHD (hazard ratio, 0.98), or intellectual disability (hazard ratio, 1.01) associated with acetaminophen use. —— The study found a **casual link** between neurodevelopmental disorders. NOT CAUSATION AND NOT JUST AUTISM ""Overall, the majority of the studies reported positive associations of prenatal acetaminophen use with ADHD, ASD, or NDDs in offspring, with risk-of-bias and strength-of-evidence ratings informing the overall synthesis."" https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0 This also concerns me. They scored the exposure in ASD studies to be biased. The worst scored categories were: ""3. Were exposure assessment methods lacking accuracy?"" ""5. Was potential confounding inadequately incorporated?"" 8 studies were analyzed. (Scoring: 1 - low risk of bias; 2 - probably low risk of bias; 3 - probably high risk of bias; 4 - high risk of bias) 3:3 4s, 4 2s, and only one 1 5:2 4s, one 3, one 2, and 4 1s Confounding was a little better evaluated. But both still have critical bias when the other data pools don't. I think there is one study each that had critical bias for ADHD and NDD. https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0/tables/6",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 22:47:11,,/r/skeptic/comments/1nnm18d/tylenol_has_not_been_shown_to_cause_autism/ng14qel/,,,ng14qel,2.0

Reduce the official numbers by criminalizing parents for diagnosis— people would obviously avoid getting their kids diagnosis and support if they risk legal consequences",127.0,127.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-22 15:06:20,,/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1nno8yq/donald_trump_autism_announcement_megathread/nflzrqr/,,,nflzrqr,254.0

1nno8yq,,TAM819,"The saddest thing about this to me is that this topic DID actually have novel research come out that made this a legitimate concern. But, all subsequent research has failed to prove a causal link. However, because this was a topic that only seemed to come up around 2019, the groundwork is perfectly laid for Trump to send his uneducated voters (factually, 66% of '24 Trump voters never went to college) to Google and have it look like he's right. Currently, if you search ""tylenol and autism,"" one of the top results is from Harvard, 08/2025, with the headline ""[Using acetaminophen during pregnancy may increase children’s autism and ADHD risk](https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/using-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-may-increase-childrens-autism-and-adhd-risk/)"". If you look deeper and can read science jargon, you'd find that it doesn't have any unique research, it's a layman's summary of a different institution's paper. Said paper also isn't novel research, it's a systematic review of existing research. The paper also concludes an associative relationship across all of the included research, which, in the world of science, is VASTLY different than causative (I can give a little explanation of the difference at the bottom for anyone confused**). The problem isn't the article; it's absolutely correct if you understand causation. The problem is that dissemination of major research usually has steps. I'm generalizing, but: 1. Someone discovers something new in a study. 2. The original study is replicated to see if the same results occur. 3. Further research is done to expand on the info already obtained. 4. This repeats until there is enough info to make a report summarizing similar findings across studies. 5. The summary is then summarized into a more digestible narrative form, and these articles are published by universities & science journals mostly to be read by other academics. 6. The story is interesting enough that it gets picked up by normal, headline type news orgs, which usually only cite back to the academic article, not any of the studies or the systematic review. Trump is having uneducated people cut in around steps 4. and 5. Not just with autism, it's an effective tactic for most of his bullshit. And that's a huge problem. Because anything before step 6, media made for the uneducated public, will often be misinterpreted. People assume they just need to know what they know, and what they don't understand will go over their heads. But that's wrong. One of the most important parts of academia is knowing what you DON'T know. Otherwise, your brain fills in the gaps with logical assumptions, which you take as understanding, and we coast nicely into the Dunning Krueger effect. No one is immune to that. Most people don't need to worry about it, because there's sources that make it digestible (and to be clear: by no means do I mean dumbed down). But when you're told you can't trust anyone, Big Pharma has an agenda, and all news but Fox is fake, you're not going to trust NPR's summary of the findings. You're gonna insist on seeing the actual data. And then you're gonna misinterpret it, ESPECIALLY if you go in with your conclusion already decided. And God, don't even get me started on confounders. This might sound crazy, but I kinda wonder if there's a population out there that like... somehow is predisposed to giving birth to autistic kids? But like also has increased sensitivity to pain for some reason? Like, some kind of population that is much more likely to struggle with the physical sensation of pregnancy, so they might take more tylenol... but also is prone to autistic kids... no clue. **Example of association vs causation in the real world: Every time there's a big thunderstorm, your car alarm goes off. There's a huge association between storms and the alarm. In real-world circumstances, that'd be enough to safely assume the thunder is causing it. The scientific method, however, would have you test your car in thunderstorms in other locations, test other loud noises, put different cars in the same scenario as yours, record what else sets off your car alarm, research the make and model to see if it's a pattern, etc. All of this research would determine that you actually have a shithead neighbor who uses the rain as cover to throw rocks at your car.",8.0,8.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-22 17:28:56,,/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1nno8yq/donald_trump_autism_announcement_megathread/nfmtn5p/,,,nfmtn5p,16.0

1nno8yq,,Old-Share5434,"Ok so here’s my take on it. RFK and his bestie, Dr Oz, plan on making lots of money from their wonder cure medication, Leucovorin. They trashed the FDA, so they can speed through approvals that haven’t been properly vetted. It’s just another one of their snake oil scams. These people are absolute degenerates. “Yes, Dr. Mehmet Oz has a direct connection to leucovorin (also known as folinic acid) through his role as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Trump administration. On September 22, 2025, Oz joined HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary in announcing FDA approval of leucovorin as a treatment for children with cerebral folate deficiency and autistic symptoms, based on NIH research showing potential improvements in verbal communication for up to 60% of folate-deficient autistic children. As CMS head, Oz stated that state Medicaid programs, in partnership with CMS, will cover the prescription nationwide for eligible children insured by Medicaid or CHIP (covering over half of U.S. children). Leucovorin is an inexpensive, generic drug with a long safety history, already used for conditions like chemotherapy side effects, and this update isn't positioned as an autism ""cure"" but as a targeted therapy for a subset of patients. Additionally, Oz has financial ties to leucovorin distribution: His supplement company, iHerb, sells folinic acid products, raising conflict-of-interest concerns amid the announcement. Critics, including posts on X, have labeled this as potential grifting, noting Oz's investments in pharma-related firms and his history of promoting unproven treatments. No prior direct endorsements of leucovorin by Oz appear in his TV or public record, but his CMS position now amplifies its promotion and coverage.”",3.0,3.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 10:15:13,,/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1nno8yq/donald_trump_autism_announcement_megathread/nfqptxy/,,,nfqptxy,6.0

1nnllxo,,trustintruth,"The article is a bit hyperbolic. [Here's](https://www.hhs.gov/-room/hhs-trump-kennedy-autism-initiatives-leucovorin-tylenol-research-2025.html) the actual announcement press release: Second, HHS will act on acetaminophen. Today, the FDA will issue a physician notice and begin the process to initiate a safety label change for acetaminophen (Tylenol and similar products). HHS will launch a nationwide public service campaign to inform families and protect public health. The FDA is responding to prior clinical and laboratory studies that suggest a potential association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. FDA also recognizes that there are contrary studies showing no association and that there can be risks for untreated fever in pregnancy, both for the mother and fetus. Given the conflicting literature and lack of clear causal evidence, HHS wants to encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration when treatment is required. Furthermore, FDA recognizes that acetaminophen is often the only tool for fevers and pain in pregnancy, as other alternatives (e.g., NSAIDs) have well documented adverse effects. FDA is partnering with manufacturers to update labeling and drive new research to safeguard mothers, children, and families.“A growing body of evidence suggests that some children suffering from autism are folate deficient within the brain—a problem that can be treated with leucovorin,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said. “Given the extent of the current autism epidemic, physicians should immediately have this treatment option available for candidate children. We are also sharing new information about the potential risks of acetaminophen so patients can make a more informed decision with their health care provider.”",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 02:46:05,,/r/sciences/comments/1nnllxo/trump_will_reportedly_link_autism_to_tylenol_but/nfpfxfg/,,,nfpfxfg,2.0

1nntx97,,21giants,"From the above post (Federal judge already threw out similar lawsuits in 2023, citing ""flawed science"") This isn't finished yet. November 1, 2024 – Plaintiffs Appeal Judge’s Rejection of Expert Testimony that Led to MDL Dismissal The team at Dolman Law Group has obtained new information on the pending appeal challenging the recent MDL dismissal. Judge Cote had excluded testimony from all plaintiffs’ expert witnesses regarding the possible link between prenatal Tylenol use and later diagnoses of autism or ADHD in children. The appeal contends that the judge improperly applied the Daubert standard by overstepping the role of gatekeeper and effectively acting as the ultimate decision-maker on scientific matters rather than simply filtering evidence. In layman’s terms, the Daubert standard requires courts to ensure that technical evidence presented to a jury is reliable, methodologically sound, and founded on recognized principles. In this case, plaintiffs’ attorneys introduced five reputable experts to illustrate how prenatal exposure to acetaminophen could impact fetal development. The appellate brief argues that Judge Cote misused the Daubert standard by disregarding established scientific practices and assuming a conclusive stance on the scientific issues at hand. It further suggests that the judge appeared to prioritize concerns about the public policy implications of acetaminophen warnings over the scientific rigor applied by the experts—an issue outside the scope of a Daubert hearing. Because the appeals process can be lengthy, we don’t anticipate a ruling until early next year. We’ll continue to share updates as new information surfaces.",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-22 23:23:23,,/r/DeepMarketScan/comments/1nntx97/donald_trump_to_make_autism_announcement_today/nfolpzd/,,,nfolpzd,2.0

1nntx97,,Fancy-Duty-2031,"APA Statement on White House Announcement on Autism September 22, 2025 Washington, D.C. — In reaction to today’s White House announcement, the American Psychiatric Association issued the following statement: “It is essential that the administration prioritizes evidence-based support for individuals on the autism spectrum and invests in long-term comprehensive research about the disorder. Vaccines do not cause autism. Claims of any such association have been repeatedly discredited in peer reviewed studies. Autism is a complex disorder, and it is incorrect to imply that a handful of studies have established causation. A strong base of evidence shows that acetaminophen, when taken as directed, is safe for use during pregnancy. Any decisions around a course of treatment should be determined by a patient and their doctor. Leucovorin (folinic acid) has not been a recommended treatment for autism. It will require many more years of research before we know if leucovorin is an appropriate treatment for individuals with autism. Autism spectrum disorders exist on a spectrum of neurodiversity. The country must focus its resources on expanding access to care and to building the evidence-base for future treatments.” American Psychiatric Association The American Psychiatric Association, founded in 1844, is the oldest medical association in the country. The APA is also the largest psychiatric association in the world with more than 39,200 physician members specializing in the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and research of mental illnesses. APA’s vision is to ensure access to quality psychiatric diagnosis and treatment",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 00:48:10,,/r/DeepMarketScan/comments/1nntx97/donald_trump_to_make_autism_announcement_today/nfoykae/,,,nfoykae,2.0

Spin this right and the hardline anti-trumpers are suddenly talking about how funding corrupts research and pressures academic to show not just a positive result, but the ""correct"" results, which isn't science.

1nod9c1,,chrisdh79,"From the article: Acetaminophen—better known by the brand name Tylenol—was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1951. But on Monday, the White House turned its back on that science-backed recommendation. “Taking Tylenol is uh, not good,” Donald Trump said during a press conference, tying taking Tylenol during pregnancy to increased autism rates, despite a lack of evidence. The president appeared to suggest that all Americans no longer consume Tylenol, though he emphasized that children and pregnant women should be especially wary of consuming the popular pain relief drug. “If you can’t tough it out, if you can’t do it, that’s what you’re going to have to do,” Trump said, implying that pregnant women are more likely to have autistic babies if they can’t handle the pain of pregnancy—or even if they experience non–pregnancy related pain or fever while pregnant. “You’ll take a Tylenol, but it’ll be very sparingly. Can be something that’s very dangerous to the woman’s health, in other words a fever that’s very, very dangerous and ideally a doctor’s decision because I think you shouldn’t take it. “And you shouldn’t take it during the entire pregnancy,” he continued. “And you shouldn’t give the child a Tylenol every time … he goes and has a shot, you shouldn’t give a Tylenol to that child.” More than any other over-the-counter drug, doctors have recommended Tylenol for pregnant women due to its wide availability and its researched safety. It is considered to be the safest fever reducer and painkiller on the market for pregnant women. Because of this, it’s also one of the few pain medications that pregnant women are allowed to consume, and they do consume it: Studies have found that two-thirds of pregnant women in the U.S. consume Tylenol during their pregnancies. Dr. Zeyan Liew, an associate professor of epidemiology at Yale University, underscored that recent doubts have been cast on Tylenol’s reputation due to what appear to be rising autism rates across the nation.",8.0,8.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 10:01:30,,/r/NoFilterNews/comments/1nod9c1/trump_79_struggles_to_say_word_for_tylenol_in_his/nfqodyz/,,,nfqodyz,16.0

The fuckwits insisted I had to start frequenting single's bars to find a father for my children so they would grow up normal. Society enjoyed blaming mothers, but then this refrigerator mother stuff was all proven to be bullshit, and that left these medical bullies sad.

1nowqvl,,cerroth,"He is the Dean of Harvard's public health school so he is definitely a legitimate scientist. He has been looking at acetaminophen in pregnancy outcomes for several years so it seems reasonable to use him as an expert witness. The fees are certainly absurd but that isn't especially surprising. The biggest issue is that they do ZERO experiments. They analyze other people's data and attempt to determine the ""quality"" of these data with meaningless, contrived metrics. No mechanism offered, no subsequent studies. There does, however, seem to be a correlation between taking the drug during pregnancy and a variety of outcomes of interest. As we all know, correlation is not causation. Do women who take Tylenol/acetaminophen have higher rates of other issues with their pregnancy that lead to taking these pain reliever medications? Probably. Are they older than those who end up not taking these drugs? Maybe. Are people who choose to take pain relievers different from people who choose not to take them? Also probably true and in many different ways. Even the studies they rely on show that over half of pregnancies are exposed to acetaminophen. This number has not changed substantially in the last twenty years and yet autism rates continue to rise. Environmental factors are almost certainly important in risk for autism, and acetaminophen may well be one of them. It is not, however, the only one. Nothing new was learned from Trump's announcement but many people are and will be deceived by it. To mothers with autistic children, this is not your fault for taking a pill. To pregnant women in pain, do not fear acetaminophen just because RFK Jr. said so. It has been used in billions of pregnancies NOT resulting in autism.",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 18:17:16,,/r/StandUpForScience/comments/1nowqvl/breaking_update_scientist_behind_trumps_tylenol/nfznnk8/,,,nfznnk8,2.0

So therefore it doesn't matter what the fuck they took if they are born autistic it doesn't mean shit that Tylenol or anything like that was taken.

Acetaminophen has been mass-marketed for about 70 years. Some festering, pumpkin-headed elected idiot stated they have found the cause of autism. Not sure how that fits in with the appointed brain worm infected secretary, claiming vaccines caused autism. Prior legal cases brought against Kenvue based on the loose correlation have been dismissed. Kenvue has the number of performance issues proceeding this idiocy.

It was a fascinating talk. She also had a graph that showed that prevalence went up when different things happened like the change in the DSM, California joining in the study, as well as when the show Big Bang Theory came out (her hypothesis was that it caused people to go for a diagnosis when they previously wouldn't have because it lowered stigma).

1nqzci5,,SuspiciousStress1,"For all those claiming it is fake.... I personally know of 2 people that died this way(1 I never knew, only the husband after the fact) I have MS(the nasty PPMS type), I am a pain patient. Our elected leaders chose to force acetaminophen into most of our pain meds in an effort to prevent overuse(over use them, you die...they didnt count on addicts becoming chemists & this only really affecting legit pain patients). Anyway, it is real. It doesn't take as much as people think. I was ""good friends""(online only)with a Canadian woman who passed from this. She had a really rough pain day, took too many meds, & died-slowly over a period of days(I want to say ~4/5d). She was scared, her family was scared, yet there was nothing anyone could do. My husband worked with a man who lost his wife & baby this way. Wife was pregnant, got sick, took too many tylenol because it was ""safe""....her & the baby both passed-took about a week. Watching videos where women are downing a dozen tylenol, yeah, this is real. Would I be shocked if a panicked/grieving husband was calling doctors in other hospitals in other locations trying to get help for his wife?? Looking for ANY answer other than ""there's nothing we can do""(which is the response, unfortunately), not one bit. This is all very sad, but unfortunately, all too real. ETA-when I say ""took too many meds,"" I am talking she took 8 instead of 6, or 9 instead of 7, not that she was an addict or downed a bottle. Think of that time when you were only supposed to take 2 doses of aleve in one day & instead you took 3...like that, but with more powerful medication(that feels like aspirin when you get to certain pain levels).",29.0,29.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-26 12:54:47,,/r/libsofreddit/comments/1nqzci5/a_pregnant_women_is_dying_in_the_hospital_of/ngaratg/,,,ngaratg,58.0

1no1q00,,TheDailyMews,"u/Emotional-Common8077 >Seeing all this talk about a link between Tylenol and autism, my first question wasn't if it's true, but why now? The increase in autism diagnoses is a serious issue, and I agree with many who say it can't be explained by genetics alone. I saw your thread. I hope you don't mind me quoting you over here. I think you've raised a concern that a lot of people have. However, it's important to frame that concern in a historical context. (Sorry about the length of the following novella.) Autism was first listed in the DSM III in 1980, a change from the previous ""childhood schizophrenia"" classification. The DSM-III criteria were narrow -- ""infantile autism"" (the term used at the time) required ""pervasive lack of responsiveness to other people, gross deficits in language development, and bizarre responses to various aspects of the environment,"" among other criteria. In 1987, the condition was renamed ""Autistic Disorder"" and the criteria were broadened. Autism was then added as a disability category under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1990. Sec. 300.111 of IDEA is a mandate called Child Find. Child Find requires that states must ensure they locate all resident children with disabilities and provide those children with services, a task is typically carried out by public schools. In 1994, the DSM-IV included a new category under the pervasive developmental disorder umbrella: Asperger's syndrome. Asperger's syndrome had different inclusion criteria than Autism (no required language delays, for example), and for the first time allowed for the diagnosis of adults. Additionally, the classification of Atypical Pervasive Developmental Disorders was replaced with the broader classification of Pervasive Developmental Disorders Not Otherwise Specified. PDD-NOS allowed for the classification of patients who did not meet the criteria for Asperger's syndrome but still suffered from a pervasive developmental disorder. In education, there had been no categories added to IDEA. But since the Child Find mandate is broad, schools were required to provide services to students with Asperger's syndrome or PDD-NOS. Those students were typically classified under the Autism umbrella. In 2000, the same year the DSM-IV-TR was released, the CDC launched Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM). ADDM monitors the prevalence of autism. It includes both children diagnosed with autism and children identified under the autism label in an educational setting. Similar to the Child Find mandate, ADDM is meant to obtain as complete a count as is possible of autistic children who meet their inclusion criteria. Following up on a 2006 Council on Children With Disabilities publication in Pediatrics, in 2007 the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a clinical report titled ""Identification and Evaluation of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders."" This report, partially a response to increasing media coverage of autism and an expanding body of information, including evidence-based support for early intervention, included new guidelines for clinicians. The AAP recommended universal screening for autism in all children at 18 and 24 months. They also announced that they had developed the ""ADS toolkit and resource guide"" to assist pediatricians in implementing their new recommendations. In 2013, the DSM-V made another major shift. Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and PDD-NOS were merged together under the single category Autism Spectrum Disorder. And while the diagnostic changes from the DSM-IV-TR to the DSM-V have come along with a tightening of criteria, the mandate in education has not changed. Schools must still identify students who require services. And children with pervasive developmental disorders typically continue to be classified under the ""autism"" label even if they do not meet the new clinical criteria. The effect of this has been that children and adults can be classified as autistic under the education framework, the clinical framework, or both. Children who are affected at school can be classified as autistic under the educational framework even if they do not meet the diagnostic criteria. And children or adults who meet the diagnostic criteria can be classified as autistic under the diagnostic framework even if they do not meet the level of disability necessary to receive services under IDEA. This combination of institutions actively searching for autistic children, better screening tools, separate criteria between schools and clinicians, broadening clinical categories, and inclusion of multiple categories under the ""autism"" label have played a role in the rate at which it appears autism prevalence is increasing. Other factors like media coverage leading to increased public and parent awareness, parent requests for evaluation, and reduction in sex-based bias in diagnosis have played a role as well. I want to be clear that I am not suggesting autism rates have actually remained flat. But the effect size you see when you look at an ""autism rates per capita by year"" graph does not paint a full, accurate picture. There are an awful lot of confounding variables.",3.0,3.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 16:24:00,,/r/publichealth/comments/1no1q00/tylenol_and_autism_megathread/nfyzve1/,,,nfyzve1,6.0

1no1q00,,SentientMonoamine,"I am seeking to have a sober discissuon based on practical findings and mechanistic plausibility. When acetominophen is metabolized, it produces a metabolite known as NAPQI - a known toxic metabolite of acetominophen, associated most widely with hepatotoxicity. Factual enough to not need a citation. The question is, can this metabolite (NAPQI) reach the fetus? Dr.Zeyan Liew found APAP-Cys in the umbilical serum of self reported pregnant women who have taken acetominophen at least once throughout their pregnancy [PMC11705965](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11705965/). APAP-Cys is the neutralized metabolic product of NAPQI and glutathione. Now the question that remains is was this metabolic transformation done in the fetus? If mostly from the mother before exposure, *to what efficacy?* Hard questions to practically answer. So, it is at least mechanistically plausible that developing fetuses are exposed to a toxic metabolite of acetominophen, but what could it do? In an article published in [translational psychiatry](https://www.nature.com/articles/tp201261) they found in post mortem brains of individuals with autism, a correlation of oxidative stress and biomarkers associated with reduced glutathione antioxidant capacity. Outside the context of Tylenol specifically, this is a discussed topic: [Antioxidants 2025, 14(3), 320](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/14/3/320?hl=en-US#:~:text=Oxidative%20stress%20refers%20to%20an,biological%20systems%2C%20including%20the%20brain.) — [Free Radic Biol Med. 2020 Nov 20:160:149-162](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32745763/) - Glutathione is a central antioxidant In our metabolism, and particularly of NAPQI. An established fact I don't need to cite. So. This brings me to my more *controversial* citation. [PMC11355895](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11355895/) Dr. Parker explicitly discusses the plausible connection of NAPQI induced oxidative stress and the development of ASD of those genetically susceptible. He is bold in his position, but believes genetic aberrations can handicap an individual's, (especially a developing fetus) metabolic capacity to neutralize NAPQI before it causes damage. And even in healthy fetuses, their cytochrome P450 system isn't developed, along with the fetal efficacy of glucoronidation or the discussed glutathione production. I'm not trying to fear monger, or definitively state that acetominophen *in fact* causes autism, but the findings are nuanced and unclear, and arguments can be made for both sides, like mechanisic plausibility (for) or inability to eliminate confounding factors (against) What I'm *really* trying to do here, is an attempt to have a nuanced discussion about a topic that gives an inherent urge to call BS on. Especially when now it's coming from the mouth of an increasingly senile orange maniac who knows absolutely *nothing* about biomedical research, or even how to pronounce acetominophen for that matter. I think there's validity to being *cautious* with the use of this medication, and using as little for as short of a window possible while pregnant, is a *sober* approach based on accumulating evidence. Stuff is *hard* to prove definitively in biomedicine, but I'm seeing way too much knee jerky ""that's such bullshit"" without any provided substance as to why",4.0,4.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 03:02:22,,/r/publichealth/comments/1no1q00/tylenol_and_autism_megathread/nfpibhu/,,,nfpibhu,8.0

1no1q00,,Foreign_Feature3849,"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406 Acetaminophen Use During Pregnancy and Children’s Risk of Autism, ADHD, and Intellectual Disability (2024) Abstract- In this population-based study, models without sibling controls identified marginally increased risks of autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) associated with acetaminophen use during pregnancy. However, analyses of matched full sibling pairs found no evidence of increased risk of autism (hazard ratio, 0.98), ADHD (hazard ratio, 0.98), or intellectual disability (hazard ratio, 1.01) associated with acetaminophen use. —— The study found a casual link between neurodevelopmental disorders. NOT JUST AUTISM ""Overall, the majority of the studies reported positive associations of prenatal acetaminophen use with ADHD, ASD, or NDDs in offspring, with risk-of-bias and strength-of-evidence ratings informing the overall synthesis."" https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0 This also concerns me. They scored the exposure in ASD studies to be biased. The worst scored categories were: ""3. Were exposure assessment methods lacking accuracy?"" ""5. Was potential confounding inadequately incorporated?"" 8 studies were analyzed. (Scoring: 1 - low risk of bias; 2 - probably low risk of bias; 3 - probably high risk of bias; 4 - high risk of bias) 3:3 4s, 4 2s, and only one 1 5:2 4s, one 3, one 2, and 4 1s Confounding was a little better evaluated. But both still have critical bias when the other data pools don't. I think there is one study each that had critical bias for ADHD and NDD. https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0/tables/6",-1.0,-1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 22:07:20,,/r/publichealth/comments/1no1q00/tylenol_and_autism_megathread/nfuhmuk/,,,nfuhmuk,-2.0

Kennedy Jr. plans to announce that pregnant women’s use of an over-the-counter pain medication is potentially linked to autism in a report that also will suggest a medicine derived from folate can be used to treat symptoms of the developmental disorder in some people, people familiar with the matter said. >The report, expected this month from the Department of Health and Human Services, is likely to suggest as among the potential causes of autism low levels of folate, an important vitamin, and Tylenol taken during pregnancy, people familiar with the matter said. >The agency also plans to pinpoint a form of folate known as folinic acid, or leucovorin, the people said, as a way to decrease the symptoms of autism, which affected roughly one in 31 eight-year-olds in the U.S. in 2022. >Tylenol, whose active ingredient is acetaminophen, is a widely used pain reliever, including by pregnant women. Some previous studies have indicated risks to fetal development, but others have found no association. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it is safe to use in pregnancy, though it recommends pregnant women consult with their doctors before using it, as with all medicines. >Kennedy’s report is expected to be a review of existing research, people familiar with the matter said. Scientists say conducting rigorous research on the causes of autism can take years. Decades of work looking for the roots of autism have found a variety of possible contributors, including genes. >Tylenol is made by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a division of Kenvue, and other companies make similar acetaminophen-based products. >Kenvue shares declined sharply after The Wall Street Journal’s report. They were down about 16% Friday afternoon. >“Nothing is more important to us than the health and safety of the people who use our products,” a Kenvue spokeswoman said. “We have continuously evaluated the science and continue to believe there is no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism.”",4.0,4.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-05 19:25:00,,/r/thescoop/comments/1n9c8w4/not_a_joke_rfk_jrhhs_says_autism_caused_by_tylenol/ncly3wr/,,,ncly3wr,8.0

1n9c8w4,,MagnesiumKitten,"When children are exposed to acetaminophen—also known by the brand name Tylenol or as paracetamol—during pregnancy, they may be more likely to develop neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism and ADHD, according to a new study. The [study](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0) was published August 14 in BMC Environmental Health. [Andrea Baccarelli](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/andrea-baccarelli/), dean of the faculty at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of environmental health, was senior author. The study was led by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and also included co-authors from other institutions. The researchers analyzed results from 46 previous studies—representing data from over 100,000 participants—that investigated the potential link between prenatal acetaminophen use and subsequent NDDs in children. The researchers used the Navigation Guide Systematic Review methodology—a gold-standard framework for synthesizing and evaluating environmental health data—which enabled them to conduct a rigorous, comprehensive analysis that supported evidence of an association between acetaminophen exposure during pregnancy and increased incidence of NDDs.",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-05 20:45:04,,/r/thescoop/comments/1n9c8w4/not_a_joke_rfk_jrhhs_says_autism_caused_by_tylenol/ncme77l/,,,ncme77l,2.0

1no1r7l,,erkose,"The Amish community's private nature and limited integration with modern healthcare systems make it difficult to get accurate data on autism cases. While some studies suggest a lower prevalence of autism among the Amish, this is likely due to under-diagnosis and under-reporting rather than a true lower incidence. Key points to understand: * Under-diagnosis: The Amish often seek medical care only when symptoms are severe. They may not pursue a formal diagnosis for a condition like autism, which can be seen as a natural part of a child's temperament or a family trait, especially if it doesn't prevent them from working. * Cultural beliefs: The Amish believe that God is the ultimate healer and may rely on folk remedies or community-based support instead of or in addition to modern medical care. They are often reluctant to use technology, which includes many of the tools used for medical record keeping and reporting. * Limited records: Because many Amish do not have health insurance and pay for care in cash, their medical interactions may not be formally recorded in public health databases. This lack of centralized data makes it challenging for health organizations to track prevalence rates. While studies have confirmed that autism exists in the Amish community, a lack of comprehensive data means its exact prevalence is not definitively known.",16.0,16.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 00:11:43,,/r/inthenews/comments/1no1r7l/trump_links_autism_to_tylenol_and_vaccines_claims/nfot5tt/,,,nfot5tt,32.0

1np52ps,,Upset-Win9519,Not political at all but I have to respectfully disagree. Your feelings are valid so in no way am I minimizing how you or anyone else feels. My understanding is these were studies done by professionals. Not his administration but I could be wrong. Feel free to correct me on that if you know differently. I've talked to people who've said they've been warned against taking Tylenol while pregnant while years ago. It's not new information. I watched the press conference to see what I could find out. He suggested you not take it for a potential link to autism. He didn't say women couldn't take it. He told them to talk to their doctor about it. You can take Tylenol it you'd like. He even said if you have a fever take it. Warning you about a potential link doesn't sound like blaming women to me. But things aren't always fair for women. Agree 💯 No women should feel responsible for their child having autism. It can be hereditary. With all the junk humans put in their bodies I can believe it has side effects. Not to say you are OP by any means. But some women are making this about them when it's about the children who are affected and will be affected by autism. I have many family members I love with all my heart. I'm happy someone is doing something. If it could help in anyway I'm all for it. Let them search! It's not about politics.. a**kissing anyone..... or women. It is about children who suffer. I'm all for women's rights but if their upset someone is telling them what to do they miss the point of people who deal with this. I love my felllow women but if this helps anyone it's worth people being upset. Anyone who wants to disagree is free to do so. Us women should all listen and respect each other.

1noqpoi,,msnbc,"From Eric Garcia, MSNBC Columnist: President Donald Trump and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. finally made their long-anticipated announcement advising pregnant women not to take Tylenol. They made this announcement even though the evidence of a link between autism and acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, is thin and the biggest study about the two showed that “use during pregnancy was not associated with children’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability in sibling control analyses.” Even his own FDA’s statement Monday that acetaminophen “can be associated with a very increased risk of autism” carried significant caveats, including that “a causal relationship has not been established.” On top of making this sweeping claim without proof, Trump —alongside Kennedy, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary, National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Director Mehmet Oz — added lie after lie. He said that autism doesn’t exist in Cuba (it does and it has at least nine autism schools, and one study showed that Cuban teachers know as much about autism as their peers in other countries). And he repeated the debunked claim that vaccines lead to autism. Trump’s words erased this progress. He spoke, for example, about how one of his employees “lost"" her son when she gave him a vaccine, developed a fever and then became autistic. These words treat autism as a sort of a loss in a certain way. They treat autism as a sentence worse than death and that mourning prevents their parents and loved ones from showing their children the love they need.

I have seen several graphics or posts of people saying “autism doesn’t need a cure” or it’s even disrespectful to insinuate that we should be looking for a cure. Brittany’s language of we should be learning more so we can better serve our AU kiddos is 100% spot on. I work with families who have kids with severe AU and those parents would take a “cure” in a heartbeat if there was one. It’s not saying these kids aren’t great and their families don’t love them, but more research for the cause of AU is important!

He didn't do that. lnstead he made some illusion to preliminary studies that suggest chronic use of tyllenol durring pregnancy may lead to higher rates of autism in children. This to my understanding is generally the sort of thing liberals (justifyably) **want** to hear out of the FDA; peer reviewed studies reviewing data and attempting to determine the positive and negative impacts of controlled substances. Trump of course said it in his normal crass, aggrandizing fashion which turns some people off but at the end of the day l just dont understand what all the upset's about beyond that. No one is going to make it illegal for pregnant women to take tylenol. All that's going to happen now is doctors and mothers are going to be more aware of the amounts of acetaminophen they take durring pregnancy and act accordingly. l have a hard time believing if this announcement had happened under the Obama administration **any** liberal in the country would have a single issue with it.

I spiked to a 104 degree fever, and baby’s heart rate was elevated for a prolonged period. Fortunately, my care team caught it and leapt into action - by administering Tylenol and antibiotics. The Tylenol reduced my fever and in turn allowed my baby’s heart rate to return to normal, but if things hadn’t turned around as quickly as they had I’d have been rushed to an emergency c-section. The baby was already in the canal by that point so it would have been a more difficult surgery. The baby’s heart rate was elevated long enough to cause concern, but fortunately she is a happy and healthy 3 month old now.

1no9x1u,,xdrakennx,"He says Tylenol because he flubbed the pronunciation of Acetaminophen.. there’s a vid of it somewhere, I’ll try and find it. TBF, acetaminophen should not be taken by alcoholics and it’s the last thing you should reach for after a rough night and it is the number 1 non-viral cause of acute hepatitis. It’s not that safe. It’s possible that based on even Obama’s FDA it would not be available OTC based on its therapeutic compared to its toxicity. It doesn’t sound like much, but consider it’s an ingredient in a lot of meds, cold, flu, etc. so if you are sick and taking pills for multiple symptoms and not paying attention you can fairly easily overdose. standard dose taken per instructions ends up being about 1000mg a day, but drs will write rx for it up to 4000mg a day. Damage to the liver can begin around 7500mg taken in 24hrs, significantly less for people who abuse alcohol, had a bender recently, or have compromised liver function. Then you have to get into long term consumption. If over the course of a week you avg 5000-6000mg a day, you are back into liver damage territory. Trump and Dr Oz don’t have data supporting their statements, but acetaminophen does need a second look by the FDA for the liver issues. Also, not a doctor and this is not medical advise, I’m also not and never will be pregnant, but I follow the Advil for any pain below the neck, on the neck, or in the sinuses, and Tylenol for headaches (except hangovers) or fever.

1no9x1u,,InfowarriorKat,"Ok so I have been weighing all this & I have some thoughts. First off, I was disappointed that the Tylenol was emphasized & the vaccines were only mentioned a few times. Alex Jones says Tylenol wears away at the blood brain barrier of the fetus & makes the vaccines more likely to do damage. I have no idea if that is the mechanism or not. My guess why they talked more about Tylenol than vaccines is because they didn't want RFK accused of finding evidence for what he believed to be true already (about vaccines). Maybe they also saw J&J as a ""less scary"" company to attack than the manufacturers of the MMR. If you remember with covid, the J&J vaccine was their sacrificial lamb. It was the only one they took off the market for safety reasons. Meanwhile, they were all unsafe. I think they took the J&J away for 2 reasons. To take away competition against Pfizer & moderna, which both had government & FDA entanglements, & to make it look like they were willing to acknowledge ANY kind of problems with a Covid vaccine, increasing their perceived credibility with the public. The Covid vaccine was too perfect & it looked suspicious. I think also Tylenol doesn't have as big of a fan club as vaccines do. It's blasphemy to say anything negative about vaccines so maybe they thought there would be less pushback. I hope this was just a gentle introduction to these ideas & they will slow leak more. I think they should make it illegal for anyone to require vaccines for education, employment, etc.",-4.0,-4.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 09:20:19,,/r/conspiracy/comments/1no9x1u/why_trump_is_saying_tylenol_causes_tism/nfqkl1l/,,,nfqkl1l,-8.0

1no0e23,,jurornumber1,"In his press conference today, President Donald Trump made the remarkable claim that Autism is directly related to supplements and pharmaceuticals, and that in Amish communities that rate of autism is ""virtually zero - i heard none"" before fact-checking himself. The quote (starting at 1:40 in the video): DJT : ""There are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines, and don't take any pills, that have no autism ... that have no autism ... does that tell you something? Is that a correct statement by the way? (turning to RFK Jr.) RFK Jr: "" There are some studies that suggest, with the Amish for example - "" (gets cut off) DJT: ""The Amish... Virtually, i heard none. See Bobby wants to be very careful with what he says, and he should, but i'm not so careful with what i say. But you have certain groups, the Amish for example, they have essentially no Autism.""

1no0e23,,beenyweenies,"""A study conducted from September 2008 to October 2009 focused on screening Amish children in two communities in Ohio and Indiana. A total of 1,899 Amish children were screened for autism spectrum disorders using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and the DSM-IV-TR checklist. Among those screened, 25 children tested positive for ASD. Out of these, 14 were further evaluated, leading to a confirmation of seven children diagnosed with ASD through the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI) [\[2\]](https://www.mastermindbehavior.com/post/do-amish-kids-get-autism#). The preliminary data from this study indicated the presence of ASD in the Amish community at a rate of approximately 1 in 271 children. Ongoing research is planned to investigate cultural norms and customs that may influence the reporting styles of caregivers within the Amish community."" *Cultural and religious beliefs significantly impact how autism is perceived in the Amish community. Certain behaviors that may indicate autism are often attributed to spiritual or moral causes, rather than recognized as symptoms of a developmental disorder. This perspective can lead to delays in seeking appropriate intervention and support. People in the community may be less likely to recognize autism-related behaviors, which can hinder recognition of the disorder and limit access to necessary services.*",3.0,3.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 01:51:21,,/r/politics/comments/1no0e23/amish_have_no_autism_claims_trump_as_he_links/nfp7v05/,,,nfp7v05,6.0

Which is why it's important to actually understand the abstracts you're googling for talking points. Let's say the women taking tylenol during pregnancy were chronically inflammed, maybe some autoimmune disorder, maybe infection due to the immunocompromised state of pregnancy, who knows doesn't matter. What matters is these women have chronic conditions which make them significantly more likely to take Tylenol during their pregnancy. You know what actually IS associated with a slightly increased odds ratio of babies having neurodevelopmental disorders? Chronic Inflammation. One single confounding scenario among countless others makes your ""slam dunk"" completely meaningless, it's a simple correlation in which a third unmeasured thing makes both the independent and dependent variable more likely to occur. There's a reason science literacy is its own course, and before lifting from the abstract people who actually know how to critically scrutinize a journal article check things like the methodolgy and the statistical analyses used. THEN you can start looking at an abstract and decide if their conclusion is actually supported by their data (spoiler alert: it often isn't).

1nqc6py,,costoaway1,"There’s plenty of good evidence. Studies by Harvard, by John Hopkins University… Results indicated that children prenatally exposed to acetaminophen were 19% and 21% more likely to subsequently have borderline or clinical ASC (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.07-1.33) and ADHD symptoms (OR = 1.21, 95% CI1.07-1.36) compared to non-exposed children. Boys and girls showed higher odds for ASC and ADHD symptoms after prenatal exposure, though these associations were slightly stronger among boys. **These results replicate previous work and support providing clear information to pregnant women and their partners about potential long-term risks of acetaminophen use.** We finalized 30 studies after the screening; 14 were ineligible. Our final selection included 16 high-quality papers - 13 prospective cohort studies, two review articles, and one meta-analysis. We included autism spectrum disorders, intelligent quotient (IQ), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), isolated language, attention and executive function, communication, behavior, and psychomotor development. **All studies showed an association between acetaminophen use and listed neurodevelopmental outcomes.** Long-term use, increased dose, and frequency were associated with a stronger association. **We extracted collective evidence from 16 studies suggesting acetaminophen's role in developing adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.** It is urgent to do more research on this association before pregnant women can be cautioned about the precise use of acetaminophen. We identified 46 studies for inclusion in our analysis. Of these, 27 studies reported positive associations (significant links to NDDs), 9 showed null associations (no significant link), and 4 indicated negative associations (protective effects). Higher-quality studies were more likely to show positive associations. Overall, the majority of the studies reported positive associations of prenatal acetaminophen use with ADHD, ASD, or NDDs in offspring, with risk-of-bias and strength-of-evidence ratings informing the overall synthesis. The use of acetaminophen in babies and young children may be much more strongly associated with autism than its use during pregnancy, perhaps because of well-known deficiencies in the metabolic breakdown of pharmaceuticals during early development. **Thus, one explanation for the increased prevalence of autism is that increased exposure to acetaminophen, exacerbated by inflammation and oxidative stress, is neurotoxic in babies and small children.** This view mandates extreme urgency in probing the long-term effects of acetaminophen use in babies and the possibility that many cases of infantile autism may actually be induced by acetaminophen exposure shortly after birth. Based on available data that include approximately 20 lines of evidence from studies in laboratory animal models, observations in humans, correlations in time, and pharmacological/toxicological considerations, **it has been concluded without reasonable doubt and with no evidence to the contrary that exposure of susceptible babies and children to acetaminophen (paracetamol) induces many, if not most, cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).** However, the relative number of cases of ASD that might be induced by acetaminophen has not yet been estimated. **We conclude that the very early postpartum period poses the greatest risk for acetaminophen-induced ASD, and that nearly ubiquitous use of acetaminophen during early development could conceivably be responsible for the induction in the vast majority, perhaps 90% or more, of all cases of ASD.** Despite over a decade of accumulating evidence that acetaminophen is harmful for neurodevelopment, numerous studies demonstrate that acetaminophen is frequently administered to children in excess of currently approved amounts and under conditions in which it provides no benefit.",-5.0,-5.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-26 02:00:43,,/r/EverythingScience/comments/1nqc6py/research_tying_tylenol_to_autism_lost_in_court/ng8hrnw/,,,ng8hrnw,-10.0

1nohxsm,,Foreign_Feature3849,"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406 Acetaminophen Use During Pregnancy and Children’s Risk of Autism, ADHD, and Intellectual Disability (2024) Abstract- In this population-based study, models without sibling controls identified marginally increased risks of autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) associated with acetaminophen use during pregnancy. However, analyses of matched full sibling pairs found no evidence of increased risk of autism (hazard ratio, 0.98), ADHD (hazard ratio, 0.98), or intellectual disability (hazard ratio, 1.01) associated with acetaminophen use. —— The study found a **casual link** between neurodevelopmental disorders. NOT CAUSATION AND NOT JUST AUTISM ""Overall, the majority of the studies reported positive associations of prenatal acetaminophen use with ADHD, ASD, or NDDs in offspring, with risk-of-bias and strength-of-evidence ratings informing the overall synthesis."" https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0 This also concerns me. They scored the exposure in ASD studies to be biased. The worst scored categories were: ""3. Were exposure assessment methods lacking accuracy?"" ""5. Was potential confounding inadequately incorporated?"" 8 studies were analyzed. (Scoring: 1 - low risk of bias; 2 - probably low risk of bias; 3 - probably high risk of bias; 4 - high risk of bias) 3:3 4s, 4 2s, and only one 1 5:2 4s, one 3, one 2, and 4 1s Confounding was a little better evaluated. But both still have critical bias when the other data pools don't.

1nog5m8,,chrisdh79,"From the article: Acetaminophen—better known by the brand name Tylenol—was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1951. But on Monday, the White House turned its back on that science-backed recommendation. “Taking Tylenol is uh, not good,” Donald Trump said during a press conference, tying taking Tylenol during pregnancy to increased autism rates, despite a lack of evidence. The president appeared to suggest that all Americans no longer consume Tylenol, though he emphasized that children and pregnant women should be especially wary of consuming the popular pain relief drug. “If you can’t tough it out, if you can’t do it, that’s what you’re going to have to do,” Trump said, implying that pregnant women are more likely to have autistic babies if they can’t handle the pain of pregnancy—or even if they experience non–pregnancy related pain or fever while pregnant. “You’ll take a Tylenol, but it’ll be very sparingly. Can be something that’s very dangerous to the woman’s health, in other words a fever that’s very, very dangerous and ideally a doctor’s decision because I think you shouldn’t take it. “And you shouldn’t take it during the entire pregnancy,” he continued. “And you shouldn’t give the child a Tylenol every time … he goes and has a shot, you shouldn’t give a Tylenol to that child.” More than any other over-the-counter drug, doctors have recommended Tylenol for pregnant women due to its wide availability and its researched safety. It is considered to be the safest fever reducer and painkiller on the market for pregnant women. Because of this, it’s also one of the few pain medications that pregnant women are allowed to consume, and they do consume it: Studies have found that two-thirds of pregnant women in the U.S. consume Tylenol during their pregnancies. Dr. Zeyan Liew, an associate professor of epidemiology at Yale University, underscored that recent doubts have been cast on Tylenol’s reputation due to what appear to be rising autism rates across the nation.",5.0,5.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 12:34:25,,/r/inthenews/comments/1nog5m8/trump_79_struggles_to_say_word_for_tylenol_in_his/nfr8yp5/,,,nfr8yp5,10.0

For many years I’ve struggled to figure out as to why people are the way they are, and more importantly why did they treat me bad(which led me to get diagnosed and then realized most of us get treated less than ideal)and I have some theory that it’s not because we can’t socialize, and it’s not because we don’t follow social cues(NT people break rules all the time so why is it fine for them but not for us)and the answer is actually simple, autistic people are free, that’s what it boils down too, other people can sense that we aren’t bogged down by the same dumb things society is, for instance the biggest being the hierarchy, which is an arbitrary thing all animals, not just humans, do where they separate themselves by rank in status, for instance animals have alphas/betas, and humans have a similar system, it’s not quite as nuanced in animals as it is humans because animals don’t have a super high logical thought process, to them it’s based on things like the strongest in the pack and whatnot, whereas humans base it off a plethora of things, anything from looks to financial status, even some people will judge a person more or less than based on if they are quiet or not, humans although much more evolved than our animal friends, still suffer from a lot of archaic ways of thinking and that’s very unfortunate.",2.0,2.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 11:43:32,,/r/AutisticPride/comments/1no1enc/trump_and_rfks_big_beautiful_autism_answer/nfxj6td/,,,nfxj6td,4.0

1nnt94b,,delkenkyrth,"After already being shaken by tariffs and investor shakeups at Kenvue, they recently published new anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies that the Trump admin took personally. So having found nothing they could pin on vaccines and autism they decided to go forward with this flimsy connection between acetaminophen during pregnancy and autism. But more specifically, they're choosing to say ""Tylenol"" over and over again in the releases and press. [https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-expected-link-autism-with-tylenol-experts-say-more-research-needed-2025-09-22/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-expected-link-autism-with-tylenol-experts-say-more-research-needed-2025-09-22/) The best research out there does not support a link. RFKJ knows this. The new ACIP committee members probably know this, if they read anything at all. There's a giant prospective cohort study of 2.5 million children that does not support concern for Acetaminophen causing autism. You have a meta-analysis of the literature in the preeminent obstetric medical journals that do not support this, and a clear look back shows the confounding factors which improperly skewed any studies that were previously thought to support it. Meanwhile CNN is playing along by running a parallel hit piece on Diphenhydramine and using another Kenvue product as the main image [Common allergy medication’s risks outweigh its usefulness, experts say](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/common-allergy-medication-s-risks-outweigh-its-usefulness-experts-say/ar-AA1JIlfH?ocid=entnewsntp&pc=LCTS&cvid=68d1954a649546dd925df6271f6e498d&ei=29). That will actively suppress Kenvue's share price. If Kenvue’s share price is down (from Trump admin policy threats, lawsuits, bad press, etc.), someone's making money on puts. Coincidentally, there was a large put/call ratio (open interest) increase by 7.0% in the last five trading days, suggesting individuals were action on non-public information. During the week of September 8, even more unusual options activity was observed, with a volume-to-open-interest ratio (V/OI) of 722.2 for KVUE. That means the number of contracts traded in a single day was **722 times larger** than the total number of outstanding contracts before that. In no sane world is that normal market activity. I guarantee you'll see some shady reporting around large options purchases around Kenvue in the next reporting period... unless Trumps SEC buries it.",88.0,88.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-22 19:00:49,,/r/JoeRogan/comments/1nnt94b/kenvue_makers_of_tylenol_began_an_antibribery/nfnchnv/,,,nfnchnv,176.0

1not9u5,,Superb_Seaweed428,"The focus has been on mothers taking it while pregnant. Rather than just association, there’s evidence that it actually causes neurodevelopmental damage when given to babies and toddlers. This is from a review published last year in the journal of Clinical and Experimental Pediatrics: “Despite the worldwide acceptance of acetaminophen (APAP) as a necessary medicine in pediatrics, evidence that early exposure to APAP causes neurodevelopmental injury in susceptible babies and children has been mounting for over a decade. The evidence is diverse and includes extensive work with laboratory animals, otherwise unexplained associations, factors associated with APAP metabolism, and limited studies in humans.” The title of their paper is, “Acetaminophen causes neurodevelopmental injury in susceptible babies and children: no valid rationale for controversy”",-7.0,-7.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 21:16:50,,/r/politics/comments/1not9u5/trumps_tylenol_directive_could_actually_increase/nfu7z7o/,,,nfu7z7o,-14.0
1not9u5,,Business_Lecture_524,"This originated with a Harvard/Mt Sinai review published last month. Researchers established association, but not causation. 46 studies were included in their analysis, and 27 of them reported an association. “Higher-quality studies were more likely to show positive associations. Overall, the majority of the studies reported positive associations of prenatal acetaminophen.” They also eviscerated the large-scale Swedish study that MSM keeps referencing non-stop from last year in JAMA. That’s what everyone was relying on to conclude Tylenol is safe during pregnancy. Unfortunately, that paper is trash. And that’s not an exaggeration. Per the Harvard group about the JAMA study: “exposure assessment in this [JAMA] study relied on midwives who conducted structured interviews recording the use of all medications, with no specific inquiry about acetaminophen use. Possibly as a result of this approach, the study reports only a 7.5% usage of acetaminophen among pregnant individuals, in stark contrast to the ≈50% reported globally [54]. Indeed, three other Swedish studies using biomarkers and maternal report from the same time period, reported much higher usage rates (63.2%, 59.2%, 56.4%) [47]. This discrepancy suggests substantial exposure misclassification, potentially leading to over five out of six acetaminophen users being incorrectly classified as non-exposed” In an August press release, the Harvard group said, “We recommend judicious acetaminophen use—lowest effective dose, shortest duration—under medical guidance, tailored to individual risk-benefit assessments, rather than a broad limitation.” So that’s where this originated.",-5.0,-5.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 22:06:06,,/r/politics/comments/1not9u5/trumps_tylenol_directive_could_actually_increase/nfuheya/,,,nfuheya,-10.0

As mentioned earlier, maternal fever in this cohort was already shown to be associated with the risk of ASD.[21] Since maternal fever is often associated with acetaminophen use, Ji et al[26] assessed the association between maternal plasma acetaminophen metabolites, measured a few days after delivery and risk of NDD in the child. Compared to those in the lowest tertile, mothers with acetaminophen in the second tertile (aOR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.70) and third tertile (aOR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.35) had an increased odds of ADHD. These associations persisted after adjusting for maternal fever, intrauterine infection/inflammation during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, the risk of ASD and other DD were not associated with maternal acetaminophen levels.” THE FUCKING LAST SENTENCE STATES IT IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE CAUSAL ASD = autism and DD = developmental disorder Citation: Raghavan R, Wang X.

IF you haven't watched Dave's series on debunking flat-earthers including the more recent videos where he traveled to Antarctica with flat earthers to see the 24 hour sun and therefore prove round(spherical) Earth, then it's 1000% worth checking out. There are so many parallels between the flat Earth cult and political cults today. In the face of the most definitive empirical evidence on that trip to Antarctica the flat-Earth community instantly devolves into conspiracy theories to avoid reconciling with the truth that the Earth is round: - The airplane did not actually take them to Antarctica - They are in a giant fake dome made to look like Antarctica - The drone footage is all faked (along with like 10 other cameras) - The members of the flat-Earth community who traveled there have been compromised and they're working with NASA to perpetuate the round Earth propaganda.

I have a friend that passed because she took nighttime Tylenol to go to sleep every night. She died of liver failure. Tylenol is not as safe as most people think. Just to clarify — acetaminophen can cause liver toxicity. That’s not misinformation, that’s literally why the FDA mandates the liver warning on every Tylenol bottle. It’s also the #1 cause of acute liver failure in the U.S. (Larson et al., Hepatology 2005). That said, it’s very safe when taken as directed (≤4g/day). Large trials (Watkins et al., JAMA 2006) show most healthy people taking max therapeutic doses for weeks only get mild, reversible liver enzyme bumps. The real risk comes from overdoses, chronic alcohol use, malnutrition, or pre-existing liver disease — that’s when even ‘normal’ doses can tip someone over. So the accurate takeaway is: Tylenol is safe for most people at recommended doses, but liver toxicity is a real and well-documented risk if dosing guidelines aren’t followed or if someone has risk factors.",-8.0,-8.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-26 18:52:31,,/r/JoeRogan/comments/1nr9cpg/tylenol_is_the_cause_of_autism_according_to_trump/ngcr9dl/,,,ngcr9dl,-16.0

1nomq0c,,SpiritAnimal_,"This is not by any means conclusive evidence, but it is a peer-reviewed paper: ""Experimental studies have shown biological plausibility of a potential adverse effect of acetaminophen on the fetal brain. Acetaminophen freely crosses the placental barrier \[58\], reaching levels in fetal circulation similar to maternal circulation within less than an hour of maternal ingestion \[76\]. Acetaminophen undergoes oxidative metabolism via the enzyme CYP2E1—present in fetal brains, placenta, and lungs \[78,79,80\]—to produce toxic metabolites \[81\]. Further, the developing brain is highly susceptible to damaging oxidative stress because it is rapidly growing and maturing and requires significant energy metabolism. Animal models show that prenatal acetaminophen exposure increases oxidative stress markers in the fetal brain and is associated with neurodevelopmental deficits \[82\]. In addition, acetaminophen also affects prostaglandin and endocannabinoid pathways, which are involved in prenatal neuronal development \[84,85,86\]. Acetaminophen is an endocrine disruptor that directly perturbs hormone-dependent processes, affects neurodevelopment and reproductive disorders, and might alter steroidogenesis in the placenta and induce placental damage. In vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo studies show that acetaminophen directly perturbs hormone-dependent processes \[87,88,89\] that are implicated in the development of NDDs \[90\]. Further, during prenatal development, the epigenome undergoes dynamic changes that regulate gene expression, contributing to brain development \[91\]. Alterations in the epigenome can alter neural networks critical for normal brain function \[93\], resulting in abnormal gene expression that may contribute to NDDs \[94\], Prenatal acetaminophen use is associated with DNA methylation changes in fetal tissues and the placenta, including at loci vital for neurodevelopment \[95\]. Similar results have been shown in children diagnosed with ADHD exposed to prenatal acetaminophen, with one study suggesting DNA methylation changes in genes involved in oxidative stress, neural transmission, and olfactory sensory pathways \[97\]. Prenatal acetaminophen exposure of human embryonic stem cells during neuronal differentiation has been shown to induce alterations in transcriptional and epigenetic regulation in early brain development \[71\], consistent with gene expression changes seen in the brains and placentas of acetaminophen developmentally exposed rodents \[99\]. A recent human study evaluating RNA sequencing changes from maternal acetaminophen exposure found placental upregulation of immune system pathways in females and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation in both sexes \[17\], aligning with earlier transcriptomic results from acetaminophen-exposed mice \[99\]. Several studies have linked elevated immune response during pregnancy with offspring neurodevelopmental disorders \[101\]. Additionally, oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies have been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental trajectories \[102\].

The ""logic"" is that because Tylenol has been in use since the 1950s and is the only pain reliever recommended by doctors for pregnant women, it must be the main contributing factor to the rise in autism diagnoses since the 1950s. Many doctors, scientists and researchers have long dismissed this as a valid theory. Earlier detection and greater awareness are the reasons for the increase in diagnoses all around the world. What today will ""accomplish"" is creating a new stigma around women using Tylenol during pregnancy, which will result in women denying themselves pain relief when they desperately need it.

1nqdwow,,irrelevantusername24,"edit: To clarify I am stating autism is -obviously- a spectrum of symptoms. Some may be unrelated from others. At the most mild it is not much more than a personality trait, it shouldn't even be a ""diagnosis"". At the opposite end it requires extra support. Which is how I look at all mental health, and health and...everything. Does it impede the ability to live day to day? Okay. That means extra support is required. What is that support and what is the best way to get that support system built? We all need support. Some have different needs than others. That's life, that's being human. If any of what is said below is offensive, I meant it in the best possible way I assure you \--- I have ADHD - which many people say has a lot of overlap with Autism. And I see some validity in that. But I have spent a lot - a lot - of time reading about [various mental health things](https://bsky.app/profile/relevantusername.bsky.social/post/3lz2zjoqgi22d), including (obviously) ADHD and [(less obviously](https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/1mvchyp/comment/n9p7z7c/)) autism. I'm like 99% sure the vast majority of ""mental health"" issues are economic problems or due to economic problems unaddressed for long periods of time then creating problems from the conflict between ""I can't cope with this untenable reality"" and every place telling you ""that's your fault, you should create some money out of your ass or something"" With autism clearly we know there is no link to either vaccines or tylonel. I think it is a failure from parents/teachers/peers/etc - and why it occurs with both poor families and wealthy ones - to teach basic social skills. Very similar to what the OG, Leo Kanner, thought: ""refrigerator mother"" syndrome. \[edit: which sounds harsher than I intended. often that failure is imposed by the circumstances of life. and it is still a systemic failure and not a personal (either parent or child) one. it is more a failure of the environment around the person to support them than anything else /edit\] Having no parent to teach social skills (re: Kanner - back then, mom was the carer, dad was the authority - which is related to modern contexts for reasons which should be obvious\*\*\*) If I'm right, it doesn't negatively affect autistic people. And actually it makes their future outlook better, because all it takes is practice and appropriate support. And at that point, autism is literally - as the etymological root of the word should teach (-ism) - a learned thing. Not an innate trait. Not something immutable. It is 100% changeable. Some might be personal change, most probably environmental. I stick to a point phrased best\*\*\* by one of the [OG's who started Reddit](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/nummi): >But you can’t control what’s inside a person’s head. Yelling at them isn’t going to make them come around, it’s just going to make them more defiant. >No, you can’t force other people to change. You can, however, change just about everything else. \--- There are a few things I think are conflated with autism. There is the relatively benign thing which is what I am mostly talking about, then there are other things which are very different. And this applies to all mental health. All there really is, is: mood disorder =/= developmental disorder =/= pathologically criminal and unable to feel empathy That last one is a big one because [they are the cause of all the problems, everywhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1km5rs9/comment/ms7xt06/), and literally the felon\*\*\* in the oval office is one. To give more validity to my point of ""my solution is simple and solves all puzzles"" while all other solutions are (opposing, dueling) black holes of increasingly obscure and improbable solutions: >In addition to Trump and RFK Jr’s recent announcement around acetaminophen, the administration said that the FDA would establish leucovorin, a type of folic acid, as the “first recognized therapeutic treatment for children with certain types of autism spectrums.” Medical evidence for the FDA's new recommendation was not immediately provided. ... [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folinic\_acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folinic_acid) >Folinic acid is also used in the treatment of cerebral folate deficiency, a syndrome in which the use of folic acid cannot normalize cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-MTHF. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral\_folate\_deficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_folate_deficiency) >For people with the *FOLR1* mutation, even when the systemic deficiency is corrected by folate, the cerebral deficiency remains and must be treated with folinic acid. Success depends on early initiation of treatment for lengthy periods. Fewer than 20 people with the *FOLR1* defect have been described in the medical literature. Riiight. So like I've been saying, what if genetics is mostly nonsense and we should focus on the real world: peoples home life, daily routines, general health-care (nutrition, etc), economics/opportunities, lived experiences, things like having lived an entire life time being ""economically excluded"" and disadvantaged by policies that are what I would consider ""human rights abuse"" (while being blamed for an inability to create money from nothing) - - - you know, things like that?",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-25 18:59:10,,/r/politics/comments/1nqdwow/im_eric_garcia_washington_bureau_chief_and_senior/ng6doh1/,,,ng6doh1,2.0

But I’ve been following some of the research on folate receptor autoantibodies and there’s legit research indicating that up to 80% of autistic people have a congenital inability for folic acid to cross the blood-brain barrier due to their immune system having antibodies against it. And folinic acid (brand name leucovorin) can circumvent the antibodies and take the place of folic acid in the brain. Clinical studies have shown positive effects on language, communication, and a reduction in repetitive behaviors. But hearing trump say it immediately makes me want to disregard the entire thing. And now I feel like I can’t ask my kid’s pediatrician about it because I’ll look like a MAGA idiot. But if it’s legit… I do want to see if it helps my son.

1nnu39p,,cbrdragon,"Edit: this this is Reddit, and people usually just throw insults while ignoring what’s being said. This isn’t a “pro-rfk” or pro trump or anything. I’m not even American. But there’s backing behind leucovorin helping some children with autism. I know this first hand. Don’t dismiss what can actually help some people because of shitty politics. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39243316/ Oral folinic acid has shown potential to improve symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are limited. This double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT aimed to compare changes in Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) scores in children with ASD aged 2-10 years, among folinic acid (2 mg/kg/day, maximum of 50 mg/day) and placebo groups at 24 weeks, in comparison with baseline. Both the groups received standard care (ABA and sensory integration therapy). Secondary objectives included changes in behavioral problems measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and serum levels of anti-folate receptor autoantibodies and folic acid, correlated with changes in autism symptom severity. Out of the 40 participants recruited in each group, 39 and 38 participants completed the 24-week follow-up in the folinic acid and placebo groups, respectively. The change in CARS score was higher in the folinic acid group (3.6 ± 0.8) compared to the placebo group (2.4 ± 0.7, p < 0.001). Changes in CBCL total score and CBCL internalizing score were also better in the folinic acid group (19.7 ± 9.5 vs. 12.6 ± 8.4 and 15.4 ± 7.8 vs. 8.5 ± 5.7, p < 0.001 for both). High-titer anti-folate receptor autoantibodies were positive in 32/40 and 33/40 cases in the folinic acid and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.78). In the placebo group, improvement in CARS score was comparable regardless of autoantibody status (p = 0.11), but in the folinic acid group, improvement was more pronounced in the high-titer autoantibody group (p = 0.03). No adverse reactions were reported in either group. Conclusions: Oral folinic acid supplementation is effective and safe in improving ASD symptoms, with more pronounced benefits in children with high titers of folate receptor autoantibodies. Trial registration: CTRI/2021/07/034901, dated 15-07-2021. What is known: • Folate receptor autoantibodies are more prevalent in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to typically developing children. • Folate receptor autoantibodies play a significant role in the neuropathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder. What is new: • Add-on oral folinic acid supplementation is safe and effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in children with ASD. • The clinical benefits are more pronounced in children with high titers of folate receptor autoantibodies.",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 07:59:03,,/r/Snorkblot/comments/1nnu39p/snouts_in_the_trough_boys/nfqdj32/,,,nfqdj32,2.0

As you say it’s really a word invented to describe people who are neurologically divergent enough from the “norm” that it causes them difficulties in day to day life.

Kids and young adults are more socially retarded due to growing up with smartphones/internet, safetyism, COVID restrictions, smaller families, anti-bullying initiatives, etc. which along with the more aggressive diagnosis results in a lot of people being classified as being within the spectrum. 3. More broadly, just plain Misandry. People love to try and Pathologize the condition of being male. Little Timmy likes trains because boys are interested in complex inanimate objects, Susan, and that's entirely normal.

1no5sd6,,joneild,"So, just to clarify, the moms aren't replacing Tylenol with folinic acid. Two different treatment goals. I work in healthcare, have a graduate degree, and have an autistic child. Speaking specifically about leucovorin, it's given to the autistic child. It is not a cure. It has shown promise in clinical studies *specifically* for speech disorders. The data does, in fact, seem sound. The dosages necessary for treatment as it was studied is significantly higher than what you would be able to give a child (a 5yr old would have to take a pile of folinic acid in OTC tablets). It's given intravenously commonly though. You can check my post history for a longer explanation on it. I looked into it about 2 months ago after my wife caught wind of it from a coworker (she works in an oncology infusion center and gives this med pretty much daily to cancer patients). Even after going through the minefield of online research, accessing my paid hospital databases, speaking to oncologists and other physicians, and my pediatrician, none of which had heard of it used for autism, the data seemed promising, but not definitive. And we are talking about it being beneficial for just speech disorders associated with autism. It's not a cure. The drug itself is, generally speaking, harmless. Our pediatrician was willing to write a referral, but we have not went any further. It was still largely unknown even 2 months ago. I feel it's probably worth throwing research money at it, but a huge rollout seems premature. Still, I wouldn't write it off solely because an insane brain parasite is pushing it.",16.0,16.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 05:01:02,,/r/somethingiswrong2024/comments/1no5sd6/because_of_course_its_a_grift/nfpwo95/,,,nfpwo95,32.0

1nor0tf,,huffpost,"**From reporters Jillian Wilson and Lindsay Holmes:** President Donald Trump held a press conference on Monday in which he claimed that the use of acetaminophen (commonly known as Tylenol) in pregnancy may be linked to autism ― although medical experts overwhelmingly stress there is very little scientific evidence that supports this statement. “Taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good,” Trump said. He announced that the Food and Drug Administration will be “strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary.” The president later admitted that his advice on the drug was coming from his own personal feelings. “I’m just making these statements from me,” he said. “I’m not making them from these doctors, because when they talk about, you know, different results, different studies, I talk about a lot of common sense. And they have that, too. They have that too, a lot.” Here's a link to the full article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-tylenol-medical-experts\_l\_68d2acf1e4b03fb4d9341baa?utm\_medium=Social&utm\_source=reddit&utm\_campaign=us\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-tylenol-medical-experts_l_68d2acf1e4b03fb4d9341baa?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=us_main)",2.0,2.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 19:35:56,,/r/Health/comments/1nor0tf/trumps_reckless_claim_about_tylenol_and_autism/nftmojr/,,,nftmojr,4.0

1npjcco,,crazylikeajellyfish,"There's a correlation <> causation distinction here, which is that mothers who take Tylenol more often are doing it because they tend to have more fevers.

In other big news, we've discovered that being in an ambulance frequently leads to death. So never go in ambulances -- DON'T DO IT!! Edit: Here's the relevant meta study, look at the discussion section, emphasis mine: > Unlike the CHARGE study, where use of any antipyretic treatment attenuated ASD risk, **adjustment for acetaminophen use in our study and the Hornig study did not alter findings**. Neither study was able to examine the impact of treatment with ibuprofen, an antipyretic with anti-inflammatory properties, since no ASD case mothers reported this exposure during pregnancy. Larger studies with information on fever and specific fever-related medications would help elucidate whether use of an anti-inflammatory to reduce fever results in lower risk of ASD compared to use of other antipyretics that do not have anti-inflammatory properties (i.e., acetaminophen). > > https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7784630/ To be clear, that last bit is saying that acetaminophen isn't an anti-inflammatory, and the inflammatory response to a fever is correlated with ASD, so it might be worth using something else.

That 2017 Tylenol comment about not taking it was more CYA than anything and they dont want to get sued. They cant really test pregnant people so they broadly say ""dont take it"" but talk to your doctor and they have been consistent on that. The recent pushback saying it’s safe isn’t some U-turn; it’s doctors saying, “don’t freak out, we need this for fevers, and the evidence isn’t that scary.” Fevers are way worse for a baby than the pill. Thats the thing with all medicines. Every one of them is a cost/benefit analysis. That huge study from last year with 2.5 million kids showed a tiny autism risk at first, but when they compared siblings who are from the same family, and have the same genes it vanished. That makes it sound like it’s not the tylenol but maybe mom’s health or something else being the cause. Other researchers are backing this, saying fevers are probably the real bad guy here. Those TikTok and X videos of folks “popping tylenol” to dunk on Trump are really dumb and mostly just people trolling for clicks. Nobody’s actually swallowing handfuls to spite anyone, at least not in droves. Trump’s throwing money at autism research, which is great, but saying tylenol causes it? That’s a stretch, and actual health professionals say its safe. Pardon me if I take their word of The Donald and Brain Worm director. Remember, correlation does not equal causation.

Generally there’ll be no issue it’s just the drug companies taking the better safe than sorry approach",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 21:07:26,,/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1npjcco/tylenol_in_their_own_words/ng0mgu0/,,,ng0mgu0,2.0

I know the ACTUAL cause of autism and I have FACTS to back it up. I alone have the actual cause and I alone will not cure it became autism doesn’t need to be cured.

For years, pregnant women were told it was the only “safe” pain reliever. What they weren’t told was that a growing body of science suggests it can deplete the mother’s glutathione (the body’s master antioxidant), making the fetal brain uniquely vulnerable to other toxins. Think about the sinister elegance of it: They push a product that weakens the child’s natural defenses in utero and then follow it with an aggressive vaccine schedule loaded with aluminum and other neurotoxins after birth.

1no9v0o,,Suitable-Display-410,"Basically, because there are studies that found a possible correlation (NOT A CAUSAL LINK!) between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the incidence of autism. And since it’s an administration of incompetent clowns, and Bobby Brainworms made this big fuss about autism for years (beeing full of shit), their supporters now expect them to deliver. So they desperately looked around for anything to point to, and came to the conclusion that the equivalent of some idiot on Facebook linking a study he doesn’t understand to “prove he is right” would get the job done. Ah, and why Tylenol? Because they dont know that a brand name and a generic name are something different, so they are unaware of the legal impications. So basically: ""hey, we found those old studies about acetaminophen, we could use that"" - ""what is acetaminophen?"" - ""its tylenol"" - ""Tylenol is the cause for Autism!

Studies are conflicting, with the two strongest studies coming to opposite conclusions. The actual scientists said that there isn't sufficient evidence to change recommendations but more research is warranted. Leucovorin is a targeted therapy for kids with specific folate metabolism deficits. Fast tracking approval isn't likely to cause much harm since leucovorin has been used in other patient populations for a long time and is already being used off-label for autism. The side effects are well understood. It would be better if it could go through the normal approval pathway but it's not as if FDA leadership doesn't meddle in reviews sometimes.

1nppshn,,Banana_bride,"I think most pregnant women, myself included, are generally pretty cautious about what we put in our bodies, including things that are considered “safe”. As an SLP who is well versed in reading research and who works with autistic individuals, what they shared isn’t new information. Yes, we know that there is a correlation with acetaminophen use and autism diagnosis, (as in as acetaminophen use increases, autism diagnosis’s has increased as well) but we know just because two things are correlated does not mean that one caused the other. There are confounding variables- the fact that Tylenol is the only safe pain reliever for women being one. If a mother had a high fever and took Tylenol, what is the fever played into the autism diagnosis?So yes, ask a mother of an autistic child if the took Tylenol, if they had a fever, had pain, etc. they probably did. So in my opinion, they didn’t share anything I didn’t know. I don’t use any OTC meds unless absolutely necessary. ETA- So just to be clear, I believe that Tylenol is safe and does not *cause* autism, but that any medication should really be limited in pregnancy.",18.0,18.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 22:45:39,,/r/pregnancy_care/comments/1nppshn/have_the_unproven_connections_rfk_jr_and/ng14gzo/,,,ng14gzo,36.0

As a pregnant woman, am I second-guessing the few times I've taken tylenol to stay sane during this pregnancy? Hell no. Having a high fever during pregnancy can cause major birth defects.

1npei73,,ScientistFit6451,"The article is behind a paywall. (It is for me, but I'm from Europe.) In other news, it's unfortunate that the autism topic gives rise to a kind of bipolar dynamic where only yes/no answers or either... or... statements are allowed, which is definitely reminiscent of how other controversial topics are treated like abortion, gay marriage or immigration. No middle ground, no acknowledgment, no multi-factorial basis which calls for case-to-case evaluation is accpepted. If someone aborts a 3rd trimester pregnancy, surely that topic should be treated differently from someone aborting a 8-week-old fetus carrying a deadly deformity. Trump and his followers as well as the neurodiversity crowd are key to this bipolarity. It's stupid to believe that vaccines or Tylenol alone are responsible for a majority of what gets currently diagnosed, or rather labelled, as autism but it is likewise unwise and unscientific to conclude that, because no such specific relations can be established, no genuine increase in disabling autistic presentations must have happened. Although I believe, very much so, that there exists something like an autism industrial complex which, in its quest to sell more services, drugs, interventions, will lobby for more screening and relaxed diagnostic guidelines, I also believe that this cannot realistically explain all of the 200 % increase that we've seen since 2008. Especially since RFK Jr. has (rightly) pointed out that the proportion of kids younger than 8 years diagnosed as ""autistic"" and ""intellectually disabled"" has increased relative to earlier years which is pretty much a guarantuee for a poor prognosis and life-long dependence on others",25.0,25.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 15:15:31,,/r/stupidpol/comments/1npei73/dr_oz_splits_from_trump_on_tylenol_after_autism/nfylj5i/,,,nfylj5i,50.0

The former president posted a video of his comments on X, telling his followers ""The degree to which those comments can undermine public health, do harm to women who are pregnant, create anxiety for parents who do have children who are autistic – is violence against the truth.” **Read more:** [**https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/25/obama-trump-kennedy-tylenol-autism-announcement/86347110007/**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/25/obama-trump-kennedy-tylenol-autism-announcement/86347110007/)",5.0,5.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-25 17:58:56,,/r/politics/comments/1nqdrx4/obama_calls_trump_administrations_tylenol_autism/ng61diy/,,,ng61diy,10.0

1no3dkn,,Choice-of-SteinsGate,"Here's how I think events unfolded: Under the direction and at the insistent behest crackpotologist and dangerously uneducated anti-vax fanatic, RFK Jr., public health agencies were tasked with locating (or drumming up) information that could be manipulated and presented in a way to establish a link between vaccines and autism. Thankfully however, decades of scientific research and rigorous studies show that there is no causal link between the two. So despite their efforts, they failed to find even remotely misleading evidence to support Kennedy's unscientific claims. As a result of this, they were then forced to pivot in another direction as part of a desperate attempt to reinforce Kennedy's baseless theories and legitimize his many grievances towards the medical community, federal researchers, scientists and big pharma. In other words, they were urged to find something—*anything* that might connect modern medicine to childhood autism. But there is no conclusive evidence that Tylenol causes autism. Although some observational studies have suggested an association, the current research does not prove causation. This still became Kennedy's saving grace. It really shouldn't have to be stated, but association does not imply causation. This is a cornerstone of scientific reasoning. Which just goes to show you how intellectually lazy our current administration is, and how dismissive these people are of scientific standards. The authors of these studies have emphasized themselves that the evidence is not strong enough to conclude that acetaminophen is linked to autism. There's also strong evidence that confounding factors could explain the dubious association. Moreover, an exhaustive study published last year by multiple institutions, which included 2.5 million children, actually found *no association* between prenatal use of acetaminophen and autism. And all while major U.S. health organizations continue to recommend acetaminophen as the *safest* OTC pain reliever for pregnant women. That being said, none of these facts make a difference to a man who has been on a decades-long crusade to blame vaccines and modern medical science for autism. And as a consequence of this, the federal government is now pushing unverified and unscientific claims on the public. This is a crisis of incompetence.",11.0,11.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 00:39:44,,/r/politics/comments/1no3dkn/trump_and_rfk_jr_link_autism_to_tylenol_and/nfoxahc/,,,nfoxahc,22.0

It's obviously another part of RFK's ""this health thing is actually not caused by [complex factors/hard-to-change lifestyle choices], its caused by [some random scapegoat] that we'll ban to make you feel safer"" conspiracy theories A lot of his supporters are uneducated (which means they're less equipped to accept complex problems or adopt ""alternative lifestyles"") so they feel ""left behind"" by the current struggle of trying to accommodate autistic people instead of reconditioning/""curing"" them. They don't want to hear this ""woke nonsense"", they want a quick and easy solution like the polio vaccine or a conversion camp.

1nodlhw,,SpiritAnimal_,"Didn't find effect size, but here's a discussion of possible mechanisms from the paper: ""Experimental studies have shown biological plausibility of a potential adverse effect of acetaminophen on the fetal brain. Acetaminophen freely crosses the placental barrier [58], reaching levels in fetal circulation similar to maternal circulation within less than an hour of maternal ingestion [76]. Acetaminophen undergoes oxidative metabolism via the enzyme CYP2E1—present in fetal brains, placenta, and lungs [78,79,80]—to produce toxic metabolites [81]. Further, the developing brain is highly susceptible to damaging oxidative stress because it is rapidly growing and maturing and requires significant energy metabolism. Animal models show that prenatal acetaminophen exposure increases oxidative stress markers in the fetal brain and is associated with neurodevelopmental deficits [82]. In addition, acetaminophen also affects prostaglandin and endocannabinoid pathways, which are involved in prenatal neuronal development [84,85,86]. Acetaminophen is an endocrine disruptor that directly perturbs hormone-dependent processes, affects neurodevelopment and reproductive disorders, and might alter steroidogenesis in the placenta and induce placental damage. In vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo studies show that acetaminophen directly perturbs hormone-dependent processes [87,88,89] that are implicated in the development of NDDs [90]. Further, during prenatal development, the epigenome undergoes dynamic changes that regulate gene expression, contributing to brain development [91]. Alterations in the epigenome can alter neural networks critical for normal brain function [93], resulting in abnormal gene expression that may contribute to NDDs [94], Prenatal acetaminophen use is associated with DNA methylation changes in fetal tissues and the placenta, including at loci vital for neurodevelopment [95]. Similar results have been shown in children diagnosed with ADHD exposed to prenatal acetaminophen, with one study suggesting DNA methylation changes in genes involved in oxidative stress, neural transmission, and olfactory sensory pathways [97]. Prenatal acetaminophen exposure of human embryonic stem cells during neuronal differentiation has been shown to induce alterations in transcriptional and epigenetic regulation in early brain development [71], consistent with gene expression changes seen in the brains and placentas of acetaminophen developmentally exposed rodents [99]. A recent human study evaluating RNA sequencing changes from maternal acetaminophen exposure found placental upregulation of immune system pathways in females and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation in both sexes [17], aligning with earlier transcriptomic results from acetaminophen-exposed mice [99]. Several studies have linked elevated immune response during pregnancy with offspring neurodevelopmental disorders [101]. Additionally, oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies have been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental trajectories [102].

1no42eo,,PupperPuppet,"Yeah, Tantrum Tangerine and Captain Brain Worm are harping on acetaminophen now. But their senior health department scientists published a carefully worded opinion piece in Politico that, without directly contradicting anything those two blowhards said, pointed out there is no evidence of any causal link between acetaminophen and autism. Meanwhile, Politico expanded on that piece today in their report that the FDA will soon approve the use of folinic acid to ""help autistic patients improve verbal communication,"" on the basis of a theory that a deficit during gestation is a cause of that symptom. Again, this is being refuted by people who actually know what the fuck they're talking about. Again, there is no evidence of such a causal link. Politico reported on the reaction to the whole acetaminophen thing from several authorities. In the US, the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continue to recommend acetaminophen for pain and fever relief in pregnant people. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency issued a statement confirming their recommendation that pregnant people can and should take paracetamol as indicated for pain and fever. As a parting shot, they remarked that any minor fetal symptoms that might happen as a result of its use (which is vanishingly rare to begin with) is certain to be less disruptive to the fetus than prolonged fever in the person carrying said fetus.

(edit: forgot abt sometimes i miss social cues, but honestly thats not hard to plan around) and thats it. yet these people prioritize ""curing"" autism over something that literally caused me to consider killing myself. SOMETHING THAT LITERALLY MADE ME CONSIDER KILLING MYSELF. and then to top it all off these people pretend like anxiety doesnt exist or really isn't that big a deal and we're just ""snowflakes"" or ""faking it"". or even get excited when someone kills themselves it just gets me so mad and so hurt and i hate it. its so dehumanizing. im nothing but a parasite to them. the first thing rfk lists as something that we autistics cant do is pay taxes and work a job. then its dating. he wants more people to profit on. hes wants more people to reproduce. oh and btw i literally have a job. i also most definitely can flirt too. not all of us can do those things but so what if they cant? theyre still people, theyre still alive, they shouldn't be valuednon what they can bring this stupid money driven society. money is a stupid concept that feels nothing, not a fucking living person who feels emotions and phsyical pain and pleasure igtg do smth so ima just end it here. as someone who is the target of both things those shiteaters are blabbing abt, i have a lot more to say but then maybe id be sitting here for hours lol 💀",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-25 20:44:59,,/r/childfree/comments/1no42eo/new_reason_not_to_have_kids/ng6zawn/,,,ng6zawn,2.0

1ntcvti,,Top-Life-2503,"In the workplace, neurodivergence is often tolerated only when it’s profitable. If your “quirks” help the company innovate, you’re a visionary. If they slow down a meeting or challenge a norm, you’re a problem. That’s not inclusion—that’s conditional acceptance. We pedestal the neurodivergent genius. The eccentric coder who pulls all-nighters and delivers brilliance. The designer who hyperfocuses into a trance and emerges with a masterpiece. These people get celebrated—but only if their difference translates into output. Everyone else? They get labeled “difficult,” “unfocused,” “not a culture fit.” And let’s name the pattern: the ones who get pedestal’d are almost always white men. The workplace is far more likely to accommodate a socially awkward tech bro than a Black woman with ADHD who challenges authority, or a trans nonbinary analyst whose nonlinear thinking doesn’t fit the org chart. The myth of the neurodivergent genius is racialized, gendered, and deeply capitalist. So what does that say about acceptance of the different? It says we don’t really accept difference—we monetize it. We tolerate neurodivergence when it’s wrapped in prestige, whiteness, and productivity. But when it shows up as emotional intensity, sensory needs, or refusal to mask? Suddenly it’s a liability. True inclusion means dismantling the pedestal. It means recognizing that neurodivergent people don’t owe brilliance to be treated with dignity. It means making space for the messy, nonlinear, non-monetizable ways we exist.

Its bigger and more evil than we even dared to imagine and so far only the ACLU is trying to track down thousands of detainees of Trump's pogroms on innocent human beings .Nazi Germany committed the worst atrocities of the WW2 era, but what is going on now in front of all our eyes is just as evil And also part of a global network stretching across Easteen Europe,China,South American countries,and the once Proud and Humanitarian Uniited States of America.

Fleischman, MD, MBA, FACOG, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) “In more than two decades of research on the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, not a single reputable study has successfully concluded that the use of acetaminophen in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children. In fact, the two highest-quality studies on this subject—one of which was published in JAMA last year—found no significant associations between use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and children’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability. Acetaminophen is one of the few options available to pregnant patients to treat pain and fever, which can be harmful to pregnant people when left untreated."" These are two parts from an article I read while doing research. How dare these old men that have no clue what they are talking about give advice on what causes Autism!! Spreading more misinformation that could potentially be harmful to mothers, their children, and other people that actually believe this. When Trump couldn't even pronounce the word acetaminophen in his press conference, seriously shows how uneducated he on this subject! Hey Trump if you ever see this from me to you, be better! Also, can you do me a favor and actually give a fuck about our countries future generations and what's best for them!

Kanner described a group of children with characteristic symptoms. Autism was formally differentiated from schizophrenia with the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980, which established autism as its own separate diagnostic category for the first time, ending a long history of diagnostic conflation and confusion between the two. Tylenol was invented in 1955 by McNeil Laboratories as a prescription-only, aspirin-free pain reliever for children. 1878: Harmon Northrop Morse at Johns Hopkins University first synthesizes acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol).

1no15px,,walkems21,"To be fair, it doesnt matter when it was created or when autism was differentiated. It could be in fact that tylenol, or another common drug, does increase risk of autism when used during pregnancy. There is no data to suggest this is true, but regardless, it could be that autism was differentiated, then tylen was created, then autism rates increased. And ofcourse this is somewhat true, in a correlation anot causation fashion. The amount of tylenol being used is positively correlated to autism diagnoses!! Not saying it is causing autism, but the point is that the statement in the post here doesnt necessarily mean tylenol doesnt cause autism! For example, lung cancer was observed or differentiated, then cigarettes were invented, and the rates of lung cancer increased; in which case, yes cigarettes did cause increased rates of cancer. This is a symmetric situation to the above, but with an opposite outcome. Hence, the above statement does NOT prove that tylenol doesnt cause autism just because autism was observed before tylenol was created.

1nnx2zw,,Skynuts,"Jag finner det fullkomligt vidrigt att försöka lägga skulden på kvinnor som, av olika anledningar, tar paracetamol under graviditeten. Det är ju inte direkt så att de har ett stort utbud att välja på. Hög feber under graviditet kan vara riktigt farligt. Skulle det vara bättre att låta fostret dö än att riskera att den får autism? Som förälder till en underbar kille på spektrumet så behövs det inte ens någon tänketid för att svara på den frågan. Inga risker som äventyrar mitt barns existens och välmående är värda att ta. Därför är han även vaccinerad till fullo. Massor av studier har motbevisat kopplingen mellan paracetamol och ökad risk för autism och ADHD. Gener är den främsta orsaken, och att antalet diagnoser har ökat så kraftigt de senaste åren beror på bättre screening, ökad kännedom och kunskap, och framför allt ökad förståelse för hur autism visar sig bland flickor. Som förälder till någon med autism så har man lättare att se autistiska drag, och det kryllar av det. Så när RFK Jr stod där och sa att det inte finns några 70-åringar med autism så ville man bara ge honom en rak höger. Det finns! Men man ska även komma ihåg hur många autistiska personer som inte klarade sig upp till 70-årsåldern, utan istället föll offer för alkohol, droger, kriminalitet och annat skit pga att samhället var grym mot dem.",3.0,3.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-23 16:25:06,,/r/sweden/comments/1nnx2zw/påminnelse_världens_största_studie_visar_att/nfsifei/,,,nfsifei,6.0
1nnx2zw,,SoderKarl,"Detta är ingen foliehattsdiskussion. Studierna visar motstridiga resultat. Det första som slår mig är att amerikanare tar högre doser och använder paracetamol längre än vad som rekommenderas i Sverige. I Sverige har vi helt enkelt varit mer försiktiga med hur vi använder läkemedel generellt och det skiljer sig stort jämfört med den generella inställningen i USA. Exempel: 20% av gravida kvinnor använder paracetamol i mer än 20 dagar i USA. Det vore otänkbart i Sverige. Det som har sagt är alltså att gravida amerikanska kvinnor behöver vara mer restriktiva med paracetamol. Den svenska studien innefattar inte så pass höga nivåer av ”missbruk” att den marginella påverkan syns. Men visst kan man i flera av de amerikanska studierna se en marginell ökning av autism och ADHD. Det som vi borde kunna enas om är att om du följer riktlinjerna som råder i Sverige samt är restriktiv i ditt användande så har det i princip ingen påvisad påverkan, om du inte är restriktiv, respekterar dosen samt period så pekar flera studier på att det visst kan finnas en liten chans till att du påverkar fostret negativt enligt vad som har sagts. https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/using-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-may-increase-childrens-autism-and-adhd-risk/",3.0,3.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 12:08:09,,/r/sweden/comments/1nnx2zw/påminnelse_världens_största_studie_visar_att/nfxmui7/,,,nfxmui7,6.0

The precautionary principle may lead many to avoid using acetaminophen during pregnancy, especially since most low-grade fevers don’t require treatment. It remains reasonable, however, for pregnant women to use acetaminophen in certain scenarios.” De pratar också om de som kroniskt använder paracetamol och det medför även risken att i en korrelations-studie så kan det vara de underliggande problemen, inte paracetamol i sig, som skulle kunna vara orsaken.

1npyeoj,,Choice-of-SteinsGate,"Here's how I think events unfolded: Under the direction and at the insistent behest crackpotologist and dangerously uneducated anti-vax fanatic, RFK Jr., public health agencies were tasked with locating (or drumming up) information that could be manipulated and presented in a way to establish a link between vaccines and autism. Thankfully however, decades of scientific research and rigorous studies show that there is no causal link between the two. So despite their efforts, they failed to find even remotely misleading evidence to support Kennedy's unscientific claims. As a result of this, they were then forced to pivot in another direction as part of a desperate attempt to reinforce Kennedy's baseless theories and legitimize his and the ""MAHA"" movement's many grievances towards the medical community and experts, federal researchers, scientists and big pharma. In other words, they were urged to find something—*anything* that might connect modern medicine to childhood autism. This was done, in part, to save face with the anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists who support this administration. But there is no conclusive evidence that Tylenol causes autism. Although some observational studies have suggested an association, the current research does not prove causation. This still became Kennedy's saving grace. It really shouldn't have to be stated, but association does not imply causation. This is a cornerstone of scientific reasoning. Which just goes to show you how intellectually lazy our current administration is, and how dismissive these people are of scientific standards. The authors of these studies have emphasized themselves that the evidence is not strong enough to conclude that acetaminophen is linked to autism. There's also strong evidence that confounding factors could explain the dubious association. Additionally, an exhaustive study published last year by multiple institutions, which included 2.5 million children, actually found *no association* between prenatal use of the over the counter drug and autism. This is all while major U.S. health organizations continue to recommend acetaminophen as the *safest* OTC pain reliever for pregnant women. That being said, none of these facts make a difference to a man who has been on a decades-long crusade to blame vaccines and modern medical science for autism. And as a consequence of this, the federal government is now pushing unverified and unscientific claims on the public to pander to the anti-vax crowd and maintain an important relationship between MAGA and these conspiracy theorists who disproportionately vote for Trump. This is not only a public health disaster, but a crisis of incompetence.",18.0,18.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-25 05:45:34,,/r/politics/comments/1npyeoj/attorneys_urge_court_overseeing_tylenol_autism/ng2wi91/,,,ng2wi91,36.0

You find a way to complement the legal strategy - whether that's through traditional channels, ambassadors and/or third parties (pharma organizations/lobbyists) - at the very least, you develop a holding statement and talking points for executives. You audit existing comms to ensure alignment. You plot out who your friends are (working with IR and GR) - and who can speak in your defense. If legal is taking action in the courts, you review the briefs and align your messaging...legal briefs are a treasure trove of information and (assuming they're unsealed) a great way to deepen your message in conjunction with legal. You also better walk over to marketing and make sure they're not about to make anything worse. If you have an events team/executive comms department - do the same.

1nos3ls,,kelcamer,"TLDR: Autistic people are more likely to self medicate with Tylenol to balance out this increased amygdala hyperactivity Answer: ""Reduced connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala during unpleasant stimulus processing was recently observed in children with ASD (117). That suggests that alterations in the interconnectivity of these structures may play a role in the blunted behavioral responses to pain in autism. Importantly, the amygdala is activated by pain as early as the first-order cortical areas (118). Thus if prefrontal networks are unable to exert inhibitory modulation, it may remain over-activated, producing a cascade of autonomic and behavioral reactions"" https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9352888/ This means autism involves reduced connections between prefrontal cortex (thinking brain) and amygdala (fear brain), resulting in amygdala hyperactivity. And....guess which drug reduces amygdala hyperactivity? That's right, Tylenol. ☠️ And guess which drug increases total amygdala <-> PFC connections?

1npbzzb,,EnvironmentalSlip327,"I feel like you should just have a joke where trump is autistic. The contrast is funny because obviously is not but if you take things he does like tantrums meltdowns and even the incoherent things he says sometimes as stimming or something could be funny. I feel like the people who find this joke funny are going to be the ones who both don’t like trump and have a passing knowledge of autism. So considering the audience you want to immediately identify your line of thinking to be with theirs / educate them as much as you’re entertaining them. For example, you could start with a concession “Now I don’t listen to trump about… well, anything. But I had my ears peaked during his speech in autism. Not because I thought he was going to find a solution on autism - I knew that shit wasnt going to happen. Just think about it, etc. (throwaway joke to break up talky feel)” After you get back into it “But I was just watching- I was just watching to see the irony. As a comedian, I find a lot of joy in finding little, subtle, almost undetectable irony in everyday situations. This was not one of those times. The whole time trump is talking about the symptoms of autism… I just started thinking of shit he did last week.” Then you immediately follow with a couple analogies that are informed and accurate about autism but parodies of trumps policies (because again, this target audience doesn’t know anything if at all about trump’s stances and policies.)

1np9l7l,,ruleugim,"> how is it possible the US government, media, scientists etc doesn’t crack down on all of these dangerous things he says?! That is the really scary part. Right now he seems to have both the legislative and the judicial branches under his thumb, but also the media is not pushing back or reporting enough, so I wonder if they're scared of repercusions if they do. Democrats don't seem to be pushing back enough, and of course there are some Republicans that do, but not enough. Media-wise, zeitgeist-wise, we seem to have lost any respect for truth and science. I remember growing up science was the way we made sense of the world. The US is discussing and passing laws based on RELIGION, and ignoring science! It's a mad, mad world. My most pessimistic side tells me maybe they're all in on it. There's a movement towards authoritarianism and all of them want it to happen. Or the power from the government + the billionaires who own most of the media is too much, and people can't resist without at least losing their jobs. My optimistic side says maybe they're letting him run with it for a while, so he implements some unpopular but convenient laws he'll pay the political price for, and when they get him out he can be blamed for everything that's wrong, so they have the perfect scapegoat. My American friends, the ones not heavily leaning democrat or republican, not too interested in world events or politics, tell me it's all a media show, they're not worried. They think nothing bad is going to happen. I must be eating up the media narrative and fear mongering because it all seems too close to a scenario in which the US becomes an authoritarian theocratic police state to me. My glimmers of hope: 1.

Our own [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-responds-evidence-possible-association-between-autism-and-acetaminophen-use-during-pregnancy) says that the link may exist but that in the cases where it's most prominent, it was found that there was chronic use of the drug, which of course will cause issues, it's a drug. This one from [Yale](https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/what-the-research-says-about-autism-and-tylenol-use-during-pregnancy/) says that while many studies have found ""associations"", they aren't conclusive, as many factors can contribute to it.

1npfclj,,NOLA-Bronco,"As someone that will admit I had Dawkins, Hitchens, and Harris' books on my shelves deconstructing religious arguments, my perception of the shift and fracturing point that served as the basis for moving much of them to the right was: the militant anti-Islamic sentiment during the ""War on Terror"" period. Krauss seems a bit different, but I admit I never followed him much and still havent, and he seems to have came on after what I would say was the initial pivot point. With their views on Islam, and you can even find all three of them explicitly saying this, there was a structure to their arguments that said yes, all religions are bad and stupid, but then carved out a special place for Islam. Where Islam was argued as uniquely incompatible with western liberal secularism and you combine that with the war on terror that really across the political spectrum normalized Islamophobia and negative vilification in ways that remain incredibly persistent into today, I think that was the clear entry point. They all three sort of attempted to explain contemporary geopolitics and history of the ME using this “One Neat Trick” fallacy that centers this notion of Islam's unique terribleness as the root of all sin and problems. Using this simple narrative as the core explainer for what in reality is actually an incredibly complex web of hundreds of years of imperialism and geopolitical forces that have driven the ME to this position in contemporary day. Which for obvious reasons plays well with right wing reactionary politics and the war of worlds narratives around the war on terror, white supremacist and western chauvinism ideology, and even Christian Nationalism. So maybe you are someone that grew up in Republican communities but hated going to church, well, here are these guys that fit you perfectly, and make you sound like you can own the libs. Libs who they increasingly fought as much as the right on these issues as the fever broke and the left began breaking on Iraq and on Islamophobia, this created a strong tension point. I think you can then directly follow Harris and Dawkins in particular get really deep into the trans rights debates, which again played right into reactionary conservatism.

Those guys weren't perfect and they had the reputation for arrogance (I met Gould and Randi and they were perfectly nice). There was always a libertarian streak among skeptics of this generation, which explains the Penn & Teller connection -- but they were more of the Do What Thou Whilst hippy libertarians and not the Well, I Guess We're Fascists Now types. Turns out slippery slopes are real. I found copies of Skeptical Inquirer in the college library and, later, Skeptic Magazine (which had its share of controversies). The much simpler web had Quackwatch run by Stephen Barrett (still around in his 90s) and the Skeptic's Dictionary by Robert Todd Carroll (who has sadly passed). With surprising speed, the movement had become shockingly popular, especially with the inclusion of the New Atheists. By the early 2010s, it felt like every skeptic had a podcast, and it all felt very progressive to call bullshit on homeopathy. But then it crested and fell apart, starting with Rebecca Watson's revelations about Dawkins (and other creeps she met at conferences). Then we had allegations about Shermer (he didn't hit on me, but I caught him eyeing my wife), who would go on to take a hard right turn. Brian Dunning went to jail for scammy behaviors. And then the entire Karen Stollznow/Ben Radford thing. Phil Plait couldn't hang with the James Randi Educational Foundation, and DJ Grothe would step in to turn it into a toxic mess (although his CFI Point of Inquiry podcasts were exceptional). Phil remains a decent guy, I think. Hell, even Robert Price, a Bible scholar/skeptic and Lovecraft expert turned out to be a rightwing menace. It all just came undone. Yet, the SGU still plugs on and Monster Talk is worth your support. George Hrab is a genuinely good guy, I think, and the folks over in Merseyside are keeping the flame alive. The big Skeptic Movement is over, but skepticism remains. My local skeptic group in Philly is still around, with a number of the same old-timers eternally remaining, but there were also a bunch of cranks and weirdos back in the mix (our treasurer was an early computer pioneer who got into a shouting match with Barrett about fluoride over dinner).

The prevalence of a certain type of white atheist or humanist who wasn’t just against religion for themselves, but wanted to basically strip it from everyone else and “reeducate” people into a more enlightened way of thinking. At first I took it for a trauma response - and as someone who was traumatized by one of the major Christian denominations, I get where it could come from. But then I started thinking about how this would play out in larger communities beyond our little white bubbles. What would happen if these people got to pursue their endgames in say black or Latino communities, where religion and spirituality have different meanings and relationships with people? I understood that the legacy of colonialism included foisting Christianity on people of color. But the thing I came to realize was that if you’re showing up in a community to “save” people from their “backwards primitive thinking” and bringing them what you believed was a better, more enlightened way of things? Were you really that different from the Christian missionaries you’re railing against? And I came to realize that there was a sort of inherent racism to some of these white left-leaning or Leftist atheists and humanists. That there were able to look at people and communities of color that had ties to their own common spirituality, and feel superior to them because of how “evolved” and “enlightened” they themselves were in comparison. How people like Bill Maher were just as fine with Islamophobia and all the racism that came with it, as some of the most conservative George W. Bush fans I’d run into in small town Ohio.

While meta-analyses of observational studies suggest weak associations (15-30% increased risk), the highest-quality evidence using sibling controls and objective biomarkers provides conflicting results. The largest and most methodologically robust studies find no causal relationship when controlling for genetic and familial factors. The research highlights fundamental challenges in observational epidemiology, including confounding by indication, genetic factors, and measurement limitations.

1nqy01b,,PHealthy,"The painkiller acetaminophen or paracetamol is one of the most widely taken drugs during pregnancy, used by roughly half of all pregnant people worldwide. But US president Donald Trump said Sunday that he thinks the medication is “a very big factor” in autism. And both the Washington Post and Politico report that an announcement from the Trump administration today will raise concerns about a link between autism and use of Tylenol by pregnant people. The details of the announcement are not yet clear. Autistic people show differences in social communication and interaction, and reported prevalence of the condition has risen in some countries in recent decades. But many researchers who study autism caution that there is insufficient data to link autism and acetaminophen and that focusing on such a link is no more than a distraction. Autism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase? “There is no definitive evidence to suggest that paracetamol use in mothers is a cause of autism, and when you see any associations, they are very, very small,” says James Cusack, chief executive of Autistica, a UK autism research and campaigning charity in London, who is autistic. “At the heart of this is people trying to look for simple answers to complex problems.” In a press briefing ahead of the announcement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to provide specifics about the administration’s conclusions. “This will be a powerful display of how the entire Trump administration is committed to addressing root causes of chronic conditions and diseases,” she said. When asked by a reporter whether an announcement linking acetaminophen and autism might confuse pregnant women, Leavitt told reporters not to jump to conclusions based on media reports that the White House had not yet confirmed. Here Nature examines the evidence for a link between the medication, which is used to treat fever as well as pain, and autism. How strong are the data connecting autism and acetaminophen? Scientists say that the most robust research does not link autism and acetaminophen use in pregnancy. “The better controlled studies are less likely to find even a small risk,” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, a psychologist who studies autism at Boston University, Massachusetts, “And even then, what we're talking about is a minor association. … We do not think that taking acetaminophen is in any way contributing to actually causing autism.” Working out whether there is a link between the drug and autism is difficult, says Viktor Ahlqvist, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and co-author of what might be the biggest study1 on the link. The medication is available over the counter, so a lot of usage is not recorded in medical databases. This means researchers rely on self-reports, which can be unreliable. Confounding factors are an even bigger problem. Women who take paracetamol in pregnancy are usually in poorer health than those who don’t, perhaps because they had an infection or an underlying condition. Any apparent link between acetaminophen and autism might therefore be explained by these other health factors rather than the drug itself. Although scientists try to adjust for such confounders in their studies, such adjustments are “rarely sufficient,” Ahlqvist says. This is one reason why studies looking for a link have produced conflicting results. The study led by Ahlqvist harnessed data on nearly 2.5 million children born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019 and — from the country’s extensive health records — data on acetaminophen prescriptions during pregnancy and on self-reported use collected by midwives, as well as whether children later received autism diagnoses. The study showed that around 1.42% of children exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy were autistic, compared to 1.33% of children who were not exposed ─ a “very small” difference, says Ahlqvist. The team also compared pairs of siblings (born to the same mother), one of whom had been exposed to acetaminophen and one who had not. Siblings share half of their genome, and share a similar upbringing and mother’s background health, so any detected difference in autism between siblings is more likely to be due to the drug. The researchers found no association between acetaminophen and autism using this method — which supports the idea that links found in other studies were really explained by confounding factors. Another large, high-quality study2 from Japan including over 200,000 children — also using sibling comparisons and published this year — found no link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism. Are there any studies that do link the medication and autism? A review3 of studies published in August in the journal Environmental Health concluded that there is an association. But researchers interviewed by Nature point instead to the contrasting results of a review4 of high-quality studies on the topic. That review, published in February, concluded that “in utero exposure to acetaminophen is unlikely to confer a clinically important increased risk” of autism spectrum disorder. “There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship and any conclusions being drawn to the contrary are often motivated, under-evidenced, and unsupported by the most robust methods ,” Monique Botha, associate professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University, UK, said in comments to the Science Media Centre, a UK press office. “We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,” says a spokesperson for Tylenol’s manufacturer, Kenvue Inc. in Summit, New Jersey.",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-26 12:09:58,,/r/epidemiology/comments/1nqy01b/trump_links_autism_and_tylenol_is_there_any_truth/ngajxr4/,,,ngajxr4,2.0

Our theory of how this may occur can be explained in the following illustration. Suppose a susceptible young boy has a fever due to a viral infection or after the MMR vaccination. His parents give him acetaminophen which increases endocannabinoid stimulation in his brain making him feel better and bringing down his fever. But the increased activation of the endocannabinoid system also decreases immune system function which prolongs the illness and leads to even more acetaminophen use. Eventually, the boy recovers but his endocannabinoid system has been dysregulated to a lower level to compensate for the prolonged over-activation. Now the neurons in his brain are not getting the proper guidance for their growth through CB1 receptors and further suffer from increased inflammation due to lack of CB2 regulation in immune system cells. **The boy develops ASD**. >...

1no5b5h,,Foreign_Feature3849,"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406 Acetaminophen Use During Pregnancy and Children’s Risk of Autism, ADHD, and Intellectual Disability (2024) Abstract- In this population-based study, models without sibling controls identified marginally increased risks of autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) associated with acetaminophen use during pregnancy. However, analyses of matched full sibling pairs found no evidence of increased risk of autism (hazard ratio, 0.98), ADHD (hazard ratio, 0.98), or intellectual disability (hazard ratio, 1.01) associated with acetaminophen use. —— The study found a **casual link** between neurodevelopmental disorders. NOT CAUSATION AND NOT JUST AUTISM ""Overall, the majority of the studies reported positive associations of prenatal acetaminophen use with ADHD, ASD, or NDDs in offspring, with risk-of-bias and strength-of-evidence ratings informing the overall synthesis."" https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0 This also concerns me. They scored the exposure in ASD studies to be biased. The worst scored categories were: ""3. Were exposure assessment methods lacking accuracy?"" ""5. Was potential confounding inadequately incorporated?"" 8 studies were analyzed. (Scoring: 1 - low risk of bias; 2 - probably low risk of bias; 3 - probably high risk of bias; 4 - high risk of bias) 3:3 4s, 4 2s, and only one 1 5:2 4s, one 3, one 2, and 4 1s Confounding was a little better evaluated. But both still have critical bias when the other data pools don't. I think there is one study each that had critical bias for ADHD and NDD. https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0/tables/6",1.0,1.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 23:07:14,,/r/autismpolitics/comments/1no5b5h/i_need_facts_and_info_to_debate_against_my_mother/ng18686/,,,ng18686,2.0

1nongzn,,embryomanofficial,"Couple of updates: The FDA sent out a letter about this which goes against Trump's strong ""fight like hell"" messaging (https://www.fda.gov/media/188843/download?attachment): \- ""while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature."" \- ""In the spirit of patient safety and prudent medicine, clinicians should consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers."" (Don't doctors already do this?) \- ""This consideration should also be balanced with the fact that acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics; aspirin and ibuprofen have well-documented adverse impacts on the fetus."" The senior author of the study that the White House is citing, Dr. Andrea Baccarelli, was paid $150,000+ to serve as an expert witness in lawsuits against Tylenol. The judge in the case dismissed the case, saying that his testimony was unreliable and that he “cherry-picked and misrepresented study results.” [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/health/harvard-dean-autism-tylenol-lawsuits-payment.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/health/harvard-dean-autism-tylenol-lawsuits-payment.html)",3.0,3.0,0.0,comment,2025-09-24 19:38:36,,/r/EmbryologyIVFSupport/comments/1nongzn/experts_push_back_on_trump_warnings_about_tylenol/ng049um/,,,ng049um,6.0
