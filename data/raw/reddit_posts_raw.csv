1no1rw5,autism,WindermerePeaks1,US - Fact Checking Trump and RFK's remarks on the cause of Autism,"For those that aren't aware, president Trump had a press conference two hours ago about finding the cause of Autism. He was not fact checked, but we are doing our best to do that for you.

For the sake of clarity across countries, acetaminophen, paracetamol, and tylenol are the same drug.

Trump's main statements were:

1. Autism is an epidemic
2. Acetaminophen use during pregnancy causes autism, pregnant people shouldn't take it, and there's ""no downside to not taking it"". And says places like Cuba can’t afford tylenol so they don’t use it and they “have virtually no autism”. 
3. Hepatitis B vaccines should not be given until the age of 12 because Hep B is a sexually transmitted disease and babies don't have sex.
4. Children are ""loaded up with"" as many as 80 vaccines at once. 
5. He stated that the Amish community has very little autism due to not getting vaccinated or taking tylenol.  
5. RFK said the department identified an ""exciting therapy that may benefit large numbers of children who suffer from autism."" Referring to Leucovorin.  
6. 70% of mothers believe that vaccines caused their child’s autism and that we should “believe the women”. 

## **FACT CHECKS** 

**EPIDEMIC CLAIMS**   

1. The rates of autism have increased largely due to increased awareness of the disorder and changes in how it is classified by medical professionals. This rate that is referenced is based on diagnosis and doesn't necessarily mean autism itself has increased, just that diagnosis have. 
2. Every time there’s been a significant increase in autism diagnoses, it’s after a new edition of the DSM is published. Autism diagnoses skyrocketed after 1980 because the DSM-III was published that year, and in that edition autism was officially separated from schizophrenia and reclassified as a communication disorder. There was another increase after 2013 when the DSM-V was published with “autism spectrum disorder” as a developmental disorder, instead of five separate disorders. In order to understand how autism is not an epidemic, we have to look at how the meaning (and diagnostic criteria and diagnosis rates) has changed over time. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3757918/  
2. The definition of epidemic is “a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a community at a particular time” - oxford, “an outbreak of disease that spreads quickly and affects many individuals at the same time” - marriam webster, “sudden disease outbreak that affects a large number of people in a particular region, community, or population” -national geographic.  
3. Autism however has gradually increased over the years. It’s not an immediate change. 

    - Compared to 20 years ago, we're now seeing more children identified with autism who identify as Black, Asian, and Pacific Islander than white. We used to think primarily white boys were impacted by autism, but now we see it's all of us—many of our communities have children with autism in them—and not just boys. Over 1% of girls are identified with autism.
    - So, we know the number of children identified with autism is increasing.
    - There has been a nearly 300% increase over the past 20 years, but if you look at any two-year period across the sites that are monitoring the number of children identified with autism, it’s somewhere between a 10%–20% increase every two years. https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/is-there-an-autism-epidemic

**VACCINES**  

1. Hepatitis B is transmitted during birth and children can also come into contact with it through household objects like razors, toothbrushes, and towels.
2. Children are not ""loaded up"" with 80 vaccines at a time. The CDC has developed the childhood vaccine schedule over decades, in close consultation with experts, based on thorough reviews of safety and efficacy evidence.  The schedule can be found here: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11288-childhood-immunization-schedule. No one has ever gotten 80 vaccines at a time. He also stated they should break up the MMR vaccine into four or five doses. The MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) only consists of three vaccines. Vaccines are combined because it reduces the amount of pokes that have to be done. Before a combination vaccine is approved for use, it goes through careful testing to make sure the combination vaccine is as safe and effective as each of the individual vaccines given separately. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/about/combination-vaccines.html  
3. During the press conference, Trump said he’s a believer in vaccines but claimed without evidence that giving vaccinations close together at the recommended ages has a link to autism. Spacing out shots as he suggests can lead to an increased risk that children become infected with a vaccine-preventable disease before returning for another visit. Though anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy, have long suggested a link between vaccines and autism, **widespread scientific consensus and decades of studies have firmly concluded there isn’t one**.
4. As for the Amish claims, it’s very hard to actually know. There’s not a lot of data. One paper published in 2010 https://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2010/webprogram/Paper7336.html said, “Preliminary data have identified the presence of ASD in the Amish community at a rate of approximately 1 in 271 children using standard ASD screening and diagnostic tools although some modifications may be in order.” That rate was lower than the general population (which at the time was 1 in 91) the paper noted, but that could be due to a variety of factors, including differences in how caregivers answered screening questions or genetic differences. The sample taken for the study was 1,899 children from two Amish communities. The DSM IV was used. This is important because the diagnostic criteria was different, as asperger’s, pervasive developmental disorder, and autistic disorder were combined. While something may be here, it’s still inconclusive. The vaccination rates among the Amish are also hard to know because there’s not much data, but one paper from 2017 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655317300962?via%3Dihub found that 98% of the parents surveyed vaccinated their children. Another paper from 2011 https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/128/1/79/30323/Underimmunization-in-Ohio-s-Amish-Parental-Fears?autologincheck=redirected found that 85% had vaccinated at least some of their children. 

**ACETAMINOPHEN**  

1. Pregnant women are already advised to take acetaminophen sparingly, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Fevers pose a risk to both the mother and the developing fetus. Studies that have been conducted to evaluate a connection between acetaminophen use and autism have so far been **inconclusive.** Multiple agencies around the world have determined the risk is inconclusive, meaning **there is no established risk.**  
2. Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, the president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a statement two hours ago stressing that acetaminophen is considered safe. ""The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks and can create severe morbidity and mortality [death] for the pregnant person and the fetus.   
3. The Trump Administration is citing [a literature review published last month](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0). Outside researchers have reviewed that article saying the review wasn’t rigorously conducted and that it cherry picked studies that supported its conclusion. The review’s senior author, Andrea Baccarelli, served in 2023 as a paid expert in a class action lawsuit against acetaminophen manufacturers, in which he testified that there was a link between the medication and autism. A judge excluded his testimony for being **scientifically unsound** and last year **dismissed the case, which is currently under appeal.** (This means that the author of a review paper that Trump is using to back the claims is biased. That case is ongoing).  
3. Other autism researcher have pointed to a large study last year [published in the Journal of the American Medical Association](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406) which found **no link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability.**   

    - This study analyzed data from more than 2.4 million children. When the researchers looked solely at children with autism, there was a small increased risk possibly associated with acetaminophen. But when the researchers compared siblings within the same families the link disappeared. The comparison allowed them to control for variables that past studies couldn’t. Siblings share a large part of their genetic background and often have similar environmental exposures in utero and at home.
    - “The biggest elephant in the room here is genetics,” Lee said. “We know that autism, ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders are highly heritable.”  

**LEUCOVORIN**  

Leucovorin is a form of Vitamin B. It has never before been **approved** for autism symptoms, though it has been used “off label”for some autism symptoms. The FDA has issued a statement that they are approving its usage for a subset of children with autism who have ""cerebral folate deficiency."" Cerebral folate deficiency can be diagnosed via a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) or with a FRAT test. 

**No clinical trials have been done**. The FDA's endorsement of the drug without the company submitting clinical trials to treat kids with autism is **highly unusual.**

The science regarding leucovorin and autism ""is still in very early stages, and more studies are necessary before a definitive conclusion can be reached,” the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement.  

The data in favor of treatment with leucovorin is “from four small randomized controlled trials, all using different doses and different outcomes, and in one case, reliant on a specific genetic variant,” the Foundation notes [on its website](https://autismsciencefoundation.org/press_releases/statement-from-autism-science-foundation-regarding-wall-street-journal-report-rfk-jr-hhs-to-link-autism-to-tylenol-use-in-pregnancy-and-folate-deficiencies/). It’s important to note as well that these studies only had a small sample size, 40 or 50 patients. In the research world, that’s a very small sample size. It doesn’t mean it’s bad, just that there **isn’t enough data yet**. 

Dr. David Mandell, a professor of psychiatry and autism expert at the University of Pennsylvania, told Reuters that leucovorin might well be a possible treatment for some children with autism, ""but the evidence we have supporting it... is really, really weak."" 

**The Autism Science Foundation [does not endorse leucovorin as a treatment for autism](https://autismsciencefoundation.org/beware-of-non-evidence-based-treatments)**, saying in a statement that “more studies are necessary before a conclusion can be reached.”

Side effects may include gastrointestinal distress, weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite, changes in taste and hair loss. Allergic reactions, seizures and infections may occur in rare but severe cases.

The long-term effects of the drug are unknown.

It’s important to note that of the doctors using leucovorin for autism that leucovorin on its own **isn’t a cure-all**. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist researching leucovorin as a potential autism treatment said that while his patients were taking the medication, they also continued other therapeutic interventions, such as applied behavior analysis and speech therapy.

Despite this, the Trump Administration has decided to fast track FDA approval of leucovorin for the treatment of autism. 

**This post will be updated with fact checks as we get them.**

1np2ooo,changemyview,Tessenreacts,CMV: The conservative view on Tylenol and autism is a tragic indictment of American anti-intellectualism.,"President Trump and members of his cabinet have continued their crusade against autism, through now stating that Tylenol (moreso the components of it) causes autism. This also goes hand in hand with statements made in March stating that people with autism don't have jobs and aren't contributing members of society.

This renewed push against autism through stating that Tylenol causes autism, is not only objectively incorrect, it's part of the conservative effort to replace rigid peer reviewed and tested academia, with reactionary approaches and policies that exclusively sounds good on paper and in their heads, but falls apart when examined with even the lightest impartial research into the subject. 

American anti-intellectualism DEFINITELY isn't exclusively a conservative phenomenon, as members of the left absolutely engages in that behavior as well, but conservatives consistently are the loudest and most willing to turn their anti-intellectual viewpoints into actual political policy.

But the Tylenol and autism issue is only a symptom of the core problem that is anti-intellectualism, and American appeal to reactionary approaches rather than engaging in the peer review process to actually make sure that what they are saying is correct.

Would love to have my view changed.   ",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1np2ooo/cmv_the_conservative_view_on_tylenol_and_autism/,4444,0,4444,1165,1758687263.0,/r/changemyview/comments/1np2ooo/cmv_the_conservative_view_on_tylenol_and_autism/,self.changemyview

Today Trump is going to announce that they have found conclusive evidence that autism is directly caused by mothers consuming Tylenol/acetaminophen (they’re the same thing Tylenol is a brand name) while pregnant which gives the fetus autism.

Obviously, if you’ve read even a small amount of information regarding this, then you know this is bogus. Autism is far too complex to simply be linked to one cause and is still being actively researched to understand the **various** factors that play into it  (genetics, developmental factors, etc).

I would write more on my thoughts on this but I have to go to work so I’ll summarize it: I’m pissed off, fed up, and am not looking forward to seeing misinformation spread by people who are deliberately trying to get our attention on things other than the main issues at hand. If you know, you know. 

Make sure to take some time to regulate today. We have a resources page linked on the sidebar and here https://reddit.com/r/autisminwomen/wiki/resources which has things we have found helpful for ourselves. My favorite is The Neurodivergent Book of DBT Skills. In this instance, I’d say distress tolerance and emotional regulation would be the skills to focus on. 

Give yourself grace today, don’t respond to people rage baiting you (purposely trying to make you mad), trolling, or otherwise just upsetting you with bullheaded ignorance. It’s okay to put dad on mute for the day if he’s just spouting off nonsense. 

Here is a good boundary message for before you mute people, I wrote it specifically for close family that you’re already fed up with but you can definitely tweak it to remove sentences or change them: 

“This is not a topic I wish to talk about with you or anyone else. I would prefer if our conversations did not include politics as it should be clear by now that I find them to be uncomfortable and not conducive to us having a good relationship. From now on, I will no longer respond to politically charged messages. I am putting myself and my own mental wellbeing first. If you care about me as I do you, you will respect this and find someone else to discuss politics with. If not, then I will have to distance myself and eventually block you if you don’t stop.” 

The person will probably freak out for the rest of the day about a boundary being established but boundaries are about you and what you will and will not put up with. This is why you mute their notifications so they can have their tantrum on their own without overwhelming you with 500 text messages an hour. On iPhone, go to your text thread then tap their name. Then slide the “hide alerts” button to green. Make sure to stick to it and block them if they keep on sending political messages. Trust me, if someone needs to reach out to you about something actually important they will. 

Again, be kind to yourself today and everyday. I know it is very frustrating and upsetting to witness this.

1nntx97,DeepMarketScan,retroviber,Donald Trump To Make Autism Announcement Today Linking Tylenol to Autism. $KVUE Crashed -6.32% ($17.18). The Science Doesn't Support It!,"**Some Context**: Policy Fear Meets Market Reality

KVUE (Kenvue, maker of Tylenol) tanked 6.32% so far on reports that the Trump administration will announce a link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism. Classic headline panic selling. The volume spiked to 40M (30% above average), signaling textbook capitulation.

Lets look at this rationally! 

**The Science Doesn't Support It**

* A massive 2024 JAMA study of 2.5 MILLION Swedish children found **ZERO associa**tion between prenatal acetaminophen and autism
* Federal judge already threw out similar lawsuits in 2023, citing **""flawed science""**
* FDA and every major medical organization still endorses acetaminophen safety when used as directed

**This is the take on Wall Street.** 

* BofA and Canaccord both issued ""buy the dip"" notes this morning
* Canaccord literally called it a ""major overreaction""
* Goldman maintaining $22 price target (27% upside from here)

# The Setup:

* Sitting RIGHT on 52-week support ($17.15-17.40)
* Historical data shows KVUE bounces 8-12% within 2-4 weeks when oversold to this degree

This is the strategy: 

* Stop loss at $16.40 (clear invalidation level)
* Targets: $18.50 → $19.50 → $20.00

**The Thesis:**

This is a headline driven overreaction to claims that lack scientific backing. Kenvue's fundamentals haven't changed. They still generate massive cash flow from OTC products, pay a 3.6% dividend, and have already won the legal battle on this exact issue.

When emotion drives a stock down significantly on no actual business deterioration, that's usually when you want to be a buyer, not a seller.

**RISKS**: Having said all of this. Please note: 

**Consumer Behavior Shift:** Even if science doesn't support it, ***scared parents might permanently switch brands!*** There could be an international contagion. Other countries often follow FDA/HHS recommendations, could hurt global sales

***Disclaimer: Not financial advice, just sharing trade ideas. Do your own DD.***

1nnq5ud,ADHD,itsalongwalkhome,Trumps cure to Autism and ADHD? Or is it actually some Harvard deans attempt to get back the $2.2B he lost in federal funding before his department is cut?,"[There was report released in August that comprised of data from 46 studies adding up to 100,000 participants which showed a slight increase in Autism and ADHD rates of children to mums who consumed prenatal acetaminophen (Tylenol).](https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/using-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-may-increase-childrens-autism-and-adhd-risk/)

[One study of 180,000 kids that I read from April 2024 showed the same thing UNTIL you controlled for siblings. The conclusion was that Tylenol was NOT causing Autism or ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38592388/)

So they analysed more studies, but less participants? The President is cherry-picking data!

The guy who conducted the study Andrea Baccarelli, Dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, had significant [federal grant cuts](https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/trump-administration-freezes-2-2-billion-in-grants-to-harvard/), to which Harvard was going to [reduce the size of the school.](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/harvard-in-the-crosshairs/harvard-school-public-health-baccarelli) I beleive he has cherry-picked data to get more federal funding.

Andrea Baccarelli even acknowledged that this is a possibility, ""He notes that even government funding can subtly shape institutional priorities.""

From the article: ""For Baccarelli, the upheaval clarifies the mission: “Easy, quick, and cheap"""" No shit.

tldr: So they lost 2.2 Billion in federal funding 4 months ago and their department who lost $200 million of that, was looking to get downsized after already firing staff and suddenly they have the miracle answer Trump and RFK have been looking for, And all they did was analyse previous peer reviewed studies. They didnt conduct anything themselves, or find any new information.

He’s Wrong.,"Sorry to state the obvious, but please make your pregnant patients aware of this dangerous Trump lie. My main concern is that pregnant women will take NSAIDs instead, and the labeling of Rx NSAIDs states that their use after about 30 weeks of pregnancy should be avoided. See **warning** from the labeling of ketorolac:

# Fetal Toxicity

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs including ketorolac tromethamine, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age.

Harvard School of Public Health Dean Andrea A. Baccarelli received at least $150,000 to testify against Tylenol’s manufacturer in 2023 — two years before he published research used by the Trump administration to link the drug to autism, a connection experts say is tenuous at best.

Baccarelli served as an expert witness on behalf of parents and guardians of children suing Johnson &amp; Johnson, the manufacturer of Tylenol at the time. U.S. District Court Judge Denise L. Cote dismissed the case last year due to a lack of scientific evidence, throwing out Baccarelli’s testimony in the process.

“He cherry-picked and misrepresented study results and refused to acknowledge the role of genetics in the etiology” of autism spectrum disorder or ADHD, Cote wrote in her decision, which the plaintiffs have since appealed.

1nnt767,options,clavidk,Don't play the Tylenol:Autism Trump/RFK bet like I did,"About 1 week ago, WSJ reported that Tylenol CEO ($KVUE) had an emergency meeting with RFK Jr. trying to get him not to publish their findings on possible connection of autism with Tylenol (which was reported to drop this month).  

https://preview.redd.it/nstp8t7n3rqf1.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d28d95b2960ee9c5395425e1ff838c9d1ba80df1

I felt RFK Jr. would NOT change course so looked into how I could play this. Turns out I was right about this as Trump has just teased the announcement for today I believe?

Quick research found re: Tylenoln/Kenvue:

* Tylenol is only like 10% or so of KVUE revenue
* $KVUE dropping 10% by end of month didn't look super juicy, only about a 1:2.5 RR from puts. 

https://preview.redd.it/cim0ltky3rqf1.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=072b74aaae546a4e5de2357e3071e74d1769386b

* But I wasn't sure if it would actually drop an additional 10% since it had dropped a fair amount already. And a 5% drop would only generate a 33% gain. Not enough for me to place a bet

https://preview.redd.it/gcyxuh1h4rqf1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aeb09715319cad3f57f319a24b2284bb4bc9804

  
So then my big brain thinks, well if people stop using Tylenol then what would they turn to instead?? ADVIL RIGHT?? I do some quick research on Advil.

*  it's owned by a company caled Haleon ($HLN) - it's an optionable ticker
* ADVIL MAKES UP 60% OF $HLN SALES
* The calls have a high spread but the R:R looks gooooood.
* I feel like a genius. 
* I buy
* I do some post-purchase research to just confirm my trade/thesis was good

And this is where I realize playing $HLN calls was a mistake in case anybody else was having the same bright idea as me.

1. The report about Tylenol is linking use of Tylenol during PREGNANCY with autism in babies
2. Advil ALREADY has issues with women using it in pregnancy

Soooooo not the slam dunk I thought it was. And yeah $HLN has not been going up at all and large bid-ask spread made it very hard to exit my position.

1nowzaf,autismmemes,_RPGabe_,Mod statement regarding autism and Tylenol,"Hello everyone, 

The mod-team has come together and decided to give a statement regarding Donald Trump and RFK Jr. saying Tylenol/acetaminophen/paracetamol causes autism. We don't know what public policy repercussions, if any, will come in the future from these words, but we felt it was important to give context and clear up a few misconceptions.

First, correlation between Tylenol and autism has not been proven with any rigorous scientific analysis.[ This article from PBS ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/research-doesnt-show-using-tylenol-during-pregnancy-causes-autism-here-are-5-things-to-know)gives a good overview, as well as this interview from [Yale School of Public Health](https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/what-the-research-says-about-autism-and-tylenol-use-during-pregnancy/). Both of these articles have references of their own as well for further reading. While some studies may claim there is an association, there is a different between association and correlation, or association and causation. 

Second, it's important to highlight why the Trump administration is pushing this agenda. As highlighted in the references above, Tylenol is consistently the most safe pain medication to take during pregnancy. This is clearly part of the continuous attack on reproductive rights. 

It is also worth mentioning that the alternative being pushed is leucovorin, otherwise known as folinic acid. Folinic acid is sold by Dr. Oz, a celebrity quack doctor who is the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Trump administration. Dr. Oz's company website, iHerb, has a disclaimer saying, ""[ Not Healthcare Advice  The products and claims made about specific products on or through this Site have not been evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration and are not approved to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease.](https://nl.iherb.com/info/disclaimer)"" iHerb and Dr. Oz have consistently failed to meet FDA guidelines, follow scientific standards, and much more. FDA guidelines under Trump may change in the future, but this is still an important piece to highlight. Just like with Elon Musk gutting the government, Trump has filled the US government with his colleagues and business partners and are consistently trying to make revenue, at the expense of us.

Last but not least, it is important to push back against the eugenicist arguments stemming from this. The underlying assumption, or warrant in these people's arguments, is that having autism is inherently wrong and therefore it must be destroyed. The truth is that autistic people are valid, wonderful, and an integral part of societies of the past, present, and future. There is no getting rid of us, and the world would not be better without us. 

Many of the troubles that come with being autistic are often external factors. This can look like parents and peers not knowing how to be supportive, a lack of accommodations, general misconceptions people have, minimal disability rights globally, and so much more. A world that centers disability rights and accommodations is a world that is more accessible and better for everyone. Instead of blaming individuals and constantly criminalizing more and more, we should seek to create systems and societies that uplift everyone. That will help far more than criminalizing/banning Tylenol, and the other things that the Trump administration pushes like criminalizing homelessness, funding more and more police and ICE, and stripping people of their autonomy and humanity, are all part of this same ideology and are connected. 

It's not often we make mod statements, especially political ones, but in this day and age, not making a statement is a position in itself. We refuse to be silent as we and others are targeted. Now, more than ever, it is important we fight back against a wave of lies, fascism, and dangerous rhetoric. We must seek to build community, find ways of resisting, and come together. We might just be a meme subreddit, but we hope to be a part of community and help build it online (which is not a substitute for real life organizing!) and create a space that is safe for all of us. And that means calling out bullshit. 

All that to say, posts spreading misinformation are not acceptable. There is a line between memes and humor and promoting unscientific facts as truth. While there are some concerns about [irony poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony_poisoning), posts making fun of this admittedly absurd statement are not outright banned, as of this moment. Just keep in mind the context your posts are made in. 

Stay safe everyone. Go pop a Tylenol for the headache Trump's statements are giving us.

1no6ev7,NewsThread,Former_Goose_5202,Trump Urges Pregnant Women to Avoid Tylenol Over Autism Concerns,"US President Donald Trump has urged pregnant women to avoid using Tylenol, claiming there is a possible link between the pain reliever and autism. Speaking from the Oval Office alongside Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump said the drug, also known as paracetamol or acetaminophen, should only be taken during pregnancy in cases of extreme fever.

The announcement comes as health authorities prepare to advise doctors against prescribing the medication to expectant mothers. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to issue a notice to physicians, initiate a label change, and launch a public health campaign highlighting potential risks.

Trump described the rise in autism cases as a “horrible crisis.” Kennedy added that the FDA will soon approve Leucovorin, a decades-old drug traditionally used in cancer treatment, as a therapy for some children with autism linked to folate deficiency.

Medical experts, however, have cautioned that the evidence linking Tylenol to autism is inconclusive, and that acetaminophen remains one of the safest pain relief options available to pregnant women. Studies have produced conflicting results, with some suggesting a possible connection while others find no clear association.

Autism rates have risen significantly in recent decades, though researchers attribute much of the increase to broader diagnostic criteria and improved awareness. Experts continue to stress that autism likely results from a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors rather than a single cause.

1nowq8g,AskUS,No-Chemist8230,Could the Tylenol–autism controversy shift Trump supporter opinions?,"I feel like this would cause a “now wait a minute…” type of thought even for those who support Trump. When it came to the whole “vaccines cause autism” argument I could see why people would be more trusting of that claim, not saying I believe it, but I can see why. People really only get it a handful of times; the only time I remember I got a vaccination other than my COVID shot was when I was a child for like the usual stuff (measles, chickenpox, ect.). 

But Tylenol is so common? I feel as though everyone has used it once in their life, or have used medications with the main ingredient such as NyQuil, Midol, Alka-Setzer Cold&amp;Flu, Mucinex, and more. Like that’s why a lot of people end up accidentally overdosing because they don’t realize how pervasive acetaminophen is as an ingredient in OTC medication.

I feel like if it was truly a risk for autism it would’ve been recognized already with how common it is, globally recognized considering it’s a common medication in other countries. 

I don’t know, I mean hey, you can disagree with your own party but I feel like a majority of Trump supporters (not to be disrespectful) follow his claims blindly (even now I see people trying to repost the Harvard study thinking it’s proof of causation when there is a literal excerpt in the study saying it’s not).

There is a definite association of high maternal fever, with fetal problems. NSAIDs are contraindicated during pregnancy because they are associated with premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If pregnant women start taking NSAIDs for fever rather than acetaminophen, there will be tragic consequences.

This is how MAGA politics works: throw out a constant stream of disinformation, distractions, and fear-mongering-- so that while people are arguing about Tylenol, bigger stories (like the Epstein files or Trump’s corruption) get lost in the shuffle.

And here in Canada, Pierre Poilievre plays the same game. No Shadow Budget. No real plan. Just a steady stream of slogans and conspiratorial rhetoric designed to distract and divide.

That’s why CBC is essential. Amid the chaos, it cuts through the noise, pushes back on lies, and makes sure Canadians hear the truth.

1nqdwow,politics,theindependentonline,"I’m Eric Garcia, Washington Bureau Chief and Senior Correspondent for The Independent, who is also the author of We’re Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation. I’ve been covering the Trump administration’s fear-mongering around autism. AMA!","**UPDATE: That is all the time I have today. Thank you all for the thoughtful questions! I really appreciate your insight and look forward to more AMAs in the future!**  
   
I'm the Washington Bureau Chief and Senior Correspondent at [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/us), covering the White House, Congress, campaigns and money in politics. I was diagnosed with autism in the 1990s and have been travelling around the country for years interviewing autistic people about their experiences, which are chronicled in my book *We’re Not Broken: Changing the Autism Conversation*. I am also the recipient of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network's Harriet McBryde Johnson Prize for Nonfiction Writing.

In the years since the anti-vaccine panic that Kennedy elevated, we have seen an improvement in how society views autistic people. But the Trump administration is putting that progress at risk. By spreading claims that vaccines and tylenol use during pregnancy cause autism, the administration is implying that autism is something to be feared and eliminated.

In addition to Trump and RFK Jr’s recent announcement around acetaminophen, the administration said that the FDA would establish leucovorin, a type of folic acid, as the “first recognized therapeutic treatment for children with certain types of autism spectrums.” Medical evidence for the FDA's new recommendation was not immediately provided.

1nodtnk,atlanticdiscussions,Bonegirl06,Trump Tells Pregnant Women to ‘Fight Like Hell’ Not to Take Tylenol,"""At a press conference today, President Donald Trump dispensed one clear piece of medical advice to American parents in a rambling, repetitive monologue: Don’t. Take. Tylenol. He told pregnant women that they could help keep their children safe from autism by not taking the drug whenever they could avoid it (“fight like hell,” he instructed). He advised parents not to give Tylenol to their young children. He denounced giving the hepatitis B vaccine to infants and suggested that parents space out their children’s immunization schedule. (“They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it’s a disgrace,” he said.) He declared that children ideally should be given the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines separately, though such individual shots are not available in the United States. “This is based on what I feel,” the president said.

Trump had been hinting at his big announcement for weeks, and it was evident that he wasn’t interested in making sure the contents had passed through the normal research process. “I don’t want to wait any longer. We don’t need anything more. And if it’s wrong—it’s not going to be wrong, but—if it is wrong, it’s fine. We have to do it,” Trump told the audience at a dinner for the American Cornerstone Institute on Saturday. Today, instead of opting for measured guidance, or urging additional research, Trump borrowed a strategy from his health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: pushing ahead with a sensational conclusion based on a handful of disputed studies.""

""During today’s announcement, Kennedy at least acknowledged the trade-offs inherent in scaring pregnant Americans off Tylenol, and allowed that, sometimes, using it is unavoidable. “The FDA also recognizes that acetaminophen is often the only tool for fevers and pain in pregnancy, as other alternatives have well-documented adverse effects,” Kennedy noted in his remarks. “HHS wants therefore to encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in the use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose and shortest necessary duration, and only when treatment is required.” (Today, the FDA posted an even more measured notice to physicians, signed by Makary, that underscored a possible association between acetaminophen and autism is “an ongoing area of scientific debate.”) Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly instructed pregnant women to “tough it out.” Sowing doubts regarding vaccines, going all in on fringe theories, and opting for extreme positions instead of embracing nuance: At MAHA’s big reveal, Trump seemed determined to steal Kennedy’s spotlight.""

1nnhibz,AutisticPride,theautisticcoach,"Blaming Tylenol, vaccines, or anything else for autism is just eugenics","I keep seeing debates about whether autism is “caused” by Tylenol, vaccines, or whatever new scapegoat people invent. Autism isn’t caused by anything. It’s a natural human neurotype. We’ve always been here and we always will.

The whole search for a “cause” is really a search for blame. And blame only makes sense if you think being autistic is bad. That is ableism. It is also the logic of eugenics.

Trump, RFK Jr., and others frame autism as a crisis. They talk about us as a problem to prevent, a mistake to eliminate. That is not neutral policy talk. That is eugenics. Disabled people are always the first to be targeted when society starts talking about prevention and reduction. Autistic people are usually first in line because our society is fundamentally autistiphobic.

And we can’t ignore the economic angle. Capitalism only values bodies that can be exploited for labor. Disabled people are seen as a drain on the system. Autistic people who can’t or won’t conform to capitalist productivity norms are cast as disposable. When politicians talk about the “costs” of autism, they are telling you whose lives they think aren’t worth living.

Liberals who argue about the “real cause” are not defending us either. They are reinforcing the same framework. If you debate causes, you are already accepting that autism is something to fix. That is complicity in ableist and capitalist narratives that mark us as broken.

Autistic liberation means rejecting this whole framework. It means refusing to see ourselves as mistakes or burdens. It means fighting for a world where our lives, our needs, and our ways of being are not only accepted but valued.

Autistic humans are not broken. We are not a crisis. We are not a burden. We are human. And autistic liberation is bound up with disability justice, with dismantling ableism and capitalism, with refusing every form of eugenics.

1nsqhbi,Defeat_Project_2025,Odd-Alternative9372,Trump’s comments on autism evoke anger and hope among autistic people and their families,"An Indiana woman with an autistic son says President Donald Trump was blaming moms when he made unfounded claims that taking Tylenol while pregnant causes autism.

- A Kentucky woman diagnosed with the condition as an adult thought Trump was villainizing autism by describing it as a “horrible, horrible crisis.”

- A Massachusetts man whose twin boys have profound autism found the Republican president’s words hopeful because it was the first time the father had seen autism discussed at the highest levels of government.

- Recent comments about autism by the Republican president and others in his administration are rippling through the United States, stirring up a wide range of views and feelings among autistic people and their families. Some welcome the renewed focus and pledges of research money for the complex developmental condition. Others are outraged by what they consider the blaming, shaming and spreading claims not grounded in science.

- On Monday, Trump repeatedly warned pregnant women not to take Tylenol, known by the generic name acetaminophen, and he fueled discredited claims about autism and vaccines. Some studies have raised the possibility that taking acetaminophen in pregnancy might be associated with a risk of autism. Many others, however, have not found a connection and no causal link has been proved.

- Meantime, scientists stress that concerns that vaccines could be linked to autism have been long debunked. A fraudulent study claiming a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was later retracted by the journal that published it. Science has shown autism is mostly rooted in genetics.

- Dr. Noa Sterling, an OB-GYN, said Trump’s comments, particularly about Tylenol, touched a nerve for many parents of young autistic children.

- “There’s this kind of narrative that you have to be careful of absolutely everything you do in pregnancy, and if you eat the wrong thing or do the wrong thing, you’re going to irreparably harm your baby,” she said. “So the Tylenol just plays directly into this fear that, ‘I’ve taken something that has caused this condition in my child.’”

- Dani Derner, who has a 4-year-old autistic son, said it is “really disappointing” that women are being blamed.

- “I personally did not take Tylenol during my pregnancy,” said Derner, of Dripping Springs, Texas. But, she said, “some women might not have a choice.”

- Some women said the blaming was reminiscent of the disproven mid-20th century theory that emotionally cold “refrigerator mothers” caused autism.

- “When I heard that he said acetaminophen was the cause, I was a little scared and a little sad because as a mom of a child with autism, I felt like maybe I was being blamed for that,” said Rachel Deaton of Fishers, Indiana, who has a 22-year-old autistic son. “We really don’t know what causes autism.”

- Kelly Sue Milano of Fullerton, California, who has an autistic son, added: “A lot of responsibility and at times criticism is placed on mothers, I think, in a really unbalanced and unfair way.”

- Some autistic people recoiled at the notion that autism is something to cure.

- “It is part of who we are,” said Dani Bowman, CEO of DaniMation Entertainment and a cast member of “Love on the Spectrum.” “My mom never took Tylenol while she was pregnant with me or my sister. My dad has autism. My sister has autism. I have autism.”

- Katy Thurman, a legal assistant in Lexington, Kentucky, who was diagnosed with autism as an adult, grew angry at the concept of eradicating autism.

- “There are actual crises going on in this country. People being autistic is not one of them,” Thurman said.

- Others were encouraged by the attention on the developmental disorder.

- “We need a voice at the table and we have to do something,” said Matt Murphy of Ayer, Massachusetts, who has twin 8-year-old boys with profound autism. “That’s the hopeful thing I take out of this -– finally, the top level of government is talking about this.”

- He said people with profound autism will need lifetime support, and federal and state governments will need to take action in many areas, including education and housing. Murphy is glad to see federal money going toward research into autism’s causes.

- “Even if you find the cause … we still have the current population that we need to support and address and help,” he said.

- Deaton, who has an adult autistic son, agrees, but worries about federal cuts affecting things such as Medicaid and special education. Those help autistic people contribute to society, get jobs and be taxpayers, she said.

- Judith Ursitti leads the Profound Autism Alliance and was among a group of people who met with the director of the National Institutes of Health in June. She said hearing the term “profound autism” in a White House event was validating and she was pleased with the list of research being funded.

- But Ursitti, mother of a 22-year-old son with autism, realizes that people on other parts of the autism spectrum found some of the language hurtful and that others in her community were outraged because they believe moms were being blamed.

- Ursitti also said some of the discussion was confusing, including the failure to tease out profound autism from other parts of the spectrum when mentioning the statistic that 1 in about 31 children is affected by autism spectrum disorder in the U.S.

- “The vast majority of people with autism don’t fall into that profound category,” she said.

- She said reactions to comments made at the White House were in some ways as diverse as the autism community itself.

- “There’s a divide that’s quite similar to what we’re seeing in our country, honestly,” she said.",https://apnews.com/article/autism-trump-pregnancy-tylenol-65e9c04d05014345364212ecaec4ee3e,249,0,249,18,1759071563.0,/r/Defeat_Project_2025/comments/1nsqhbi/trumps_comments_on_autism_evoke_anger_and_hope/,apnews.com

The quote (starting at 1:40 in the video): 

DJT : ""There are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines, and don't take any pills, that have no autism ... that have no autism ... does that tell you something? Is that a correct statement by the way? (turning to RFK Jr.) 

RFK Jr: "" There are some studies that suggest, with the Amish for example - "" (gets cut off)

DJT: ""The Amish... Virtually, i heard none. See Bobby wants to be very careful with what he says, and he should, but i'm not so careful with what i say. But you have certain groups, the Amish for example, they have essentially no Autism.""

So the president just openly admits, in a press conference that they've found the cure for autism, that he doesn't know, and in fact does not care, whether the statements he is making are true.

After years of research, no study has shown that acetaminophen, the main ingredient in Tylenol, causes autism. There's no known single cause of autism, a neurological condition that influences how someone acts and communicates.

But some scientific terms, like ""association,"" can confuse the issue. There's some research that says there's an association between taking acetaminophen during pregnancy and autism. There's also some research that says there's not an association.

But either way, there's an important caveat: ""Association"" is not the same as causation.

1npjcco,TrueUnpopularOpinion,SuccessfulCompany294,Tylenol in their own words,"Many people are wrong about this latest Tylenol controversy who say its totally safe for pregnant women. 

This post has nothing to do with the autism claims which is why this subject is even news, but I will post the two studies and you can read them for yourself. I do not and am not making any claim that Tylenol causes autism.

This will be be about the claim that Tylenol is safe for pregnant women.  

Tylenol in 2017 said they do not recommend taking ANY of their products during pregnancy. This isn’t a conspiracy against Tylenol it’s their own recommendation. Now everyone is coming out saying it’s safe for pregnancy. What an odd coincidence I wonder what changed? 

Did someone say something that people didn’t like? Tylenol has NEVER actually conducted studies on their own drug to see if it IS safe for pregnant women. They have only RECENTLY in the last day said they have a study, but have not posted ANY proof of it. 

Previously people were saying there is no study cause its not safe to conduct it on pregnant women. Mind you, Pregnant women are advised to stay away from almost every pharmaceutical drug, listen to any pharmaceutical commercial, you will hear them say ""Do not take if you are pregnant or trying to be.""

So how is there an ethical study now, that previously has never been released and does this study exist today one day after this news broke, when it didn't exist last week. Who conducted an ethical study on pregnant women and how was it conducted. ZERO PROOF Offered, all talk zero evidence, and if you THINK there is proof, post it here.

Anyone here, now or in the future saying its safe for pregnant women to take drugs prescription or not is lying to you, every Pharma commercial literally tells you not to. Just listen to any of them on TV every other commercial. 

So whats easier, put it on the market and make it OTC, so anyone can buy it and just say ""ask your doctor."" What study does your doctor have to go off of? Let me guess millions of people rush to their doctor for recommendations about OTC meds, lmfao. Tylenol took the easy way out. Trump has somehow managed to make the anti big pharma be totally in the pocket of big pharma, imagine that.

There are people in this very thread trying to now claim that just because Tylenol says they recommend you not take it while pregnant is them saying they are not actually telling you to not take it. Read that twice, then read through this thread.

However now, just a few years later after Tylenol said they do not recommend pregnant women take this drug, people want you taking it.

Too much Tylenol in pregnancy could affect development
By Kathryn Doyle November 22, 2013

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Expectant mothers often take Tylenol, with the active ingredient acetaminophen, to deal with back pain, headaches or mild fevers during pregnancy. But frequent use may be linked to poorer language skills and behavior problems among their children, according to a new study.

As the most popular over-the-counter drug in the U.S., Tylenol has been extensively studied in relation to premature birth and miscarriage, with no connections found.

But its maker Johnson &amp; Johnson periodically comes under fire for the drug's small therapeutic index - that is, the difference between an effective dose and a dangerous dose is quite small. So interest in investigating the drug persists.
The new study is the first to look at young children whose mothers took Tylenol while pregnant.

""Our findings suggest that (acetaminophen) might not be as harmless as we think,"" Ragnhild Eek Brandlistuen said. She led the study at the School of Pharmacy at the University of Oslo in Norway.

She and her coauthors studied 48,000 Norwegian children whose mothers answered survey questions about their medication use at weeks 17 and 30 of pregnancy, and again six months after giving birth.

Mothers filled out a follow-up questionnaire about their child's developmental milestones three years later.
Close to four percent of women took Tylenol for at least 28 days total during pregnancy.

Their children seemed to have poorer motor skills than kids whose mothers had taken the drug fewer times or not at all. Tylenol-exposed kids also tended to start walking later, have poorer communication and language skills and more behavior problems.

It's difficult to define risks for pregnant women and their children, since rigorous tests and controlled studies of drug exposure aren't ethical, Brandlistuen said. All researchers can do is closely observe women in the real world.


But this study, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, involved a large number of women, and researchers also looked for any link to ibuprofen, a pain-relief alternative without acetaminophen.

They found no development problems tied to ibuprofen.

As far as Autism, there are studies and I don't know the validity of them nor will I make judgement, I will just post them. I dont wish to get into the autism debate, I only wish to address the claims that somehow Tylenol is now somehow safe and there IS an ethical study by Tylenol that didn't exist until Yesterday.

Mount Sini Study 

""New York, NY (August 13, 2025)  Researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in children. The study, published today in BMC Environmental Health, is the first to apply the rigorous Navigation Guide methodology to systematically evaluate the rigor and quality of the scientific literature.

Acetaminophen (often sold under the brand name Tylenol®, and known as paracetamol outside the United States and Canada) is the most commonly used over-the-counter pain and fever medication during pregnancy and is used by more than half of pregnant women worldwide. Until now, acetaminophen has been considered the safest option for managing headache, fever, and other pain. Analysis by the Mount Sinai-led team of 46 studies incorporating data from more than 100,000 participants across multiple countries challenges this perception and underscores the need for both caution and further study.""

""Taking Tylenol during pregnancy associated with elevated risks for autism, ADHD

Yes there is small evidence showing a correlation between acetaminophen and autism, but the FDA in their statement has even recognized this doesn’t equal causation. If you want to be careful about what you put in your body that’s totally fine and I get it. I also understand if Trump wishes to collect more stats, totally nothing wrong with that either.

However, he is really hyping up Leucovorin as a new FDA approved drug for use to treat autism (which was probably done with pressure from either Trump or RFK or both). Same thing; studies have shown some promise but only a few are double blind and only a few record long term effects, and most are very small studies.

If Tylenol is bad to put into your body, but Leucovorin is fine now with the same body of study, what gives?

1nno59l,TheRaceTo10Million,Thereian,Trump Autism Announcement Play,"Today Trump will have a press conference with RFK announcing a breakthrough in Autism research. The market has focused a lot on Tylenol producers due to news that the conference [will link Tylenol use to Autism](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/21/trump-autism-tylenol-acetaminophen-fever-00574564).

However, there’s another bigger play not even on the market radar. This morning the FDA [quietly put out a press release](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2025-18430/approval-of-previously-withdrawn-new-drug-application-wellcovorin-leucovorin-calcium-tablets) that they’re requesting $GSK to resubmit a formally withdrawn drug for approval in Autism.

[Here’s a relevant X post](https://x.com/alecgaffney/status/1970110267674771934?s=46&amp;t=uefgJpGogAsXoAtQo_xL2A), text pasted here.

“How strange is this?

The drug's original manufacturer, GSK, didn't even ask FDA to do this. 

FDA said it plans to as GSK to submit a supplemental New Drug Application to revise the prescribing information.”

So what’s the play? At today’s press conference, I think Trump and RFK will brag about this new found “treatment.” (I have not reviewed the data and have no opinion on the actual drug effectiveness.)

Nonetheless, $GSK may rally even a little on the news. The IP of the drug has long expired, but in a new indication they’ll get 3 years exclusivity.

The play: weekly calls, $41C. This is highly risky. If nothing gets said in the press conference these are likely a zero. If it does get mentioned or the news picks it up, it could pop a few percent and therefore the calls would go up substantially. I have something close to $65k in calls across 3 accounts.

1noz1ar,TrueUnpopularOpinion,HumbleEngineering315,The whole Tylenol-autism-pregnancy panic should be a push for decentralized healthcare,"Recently, the Trump administration came out and said that [Tylenol was correlated to autism](https://www.youtube.com/live/esKFMCb_hYU?t=266s) in children when taken during pregnancy.

The problem being is that the study that the Trump administration cited showed a very weak correlation between Tylenol and autism. The correlation was hardly enough to act on, much less announce a proclamation. And there was a huge conflict of interest by the authors of the study cited.

Almost immediately, [multiple](https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/acetaminophen-is-safe-for-children-when-taken-as-directed-no-link-to-autism/) [healthcare](https://health.ucdavis.edu/news/headlines/uc-davis-mind-institute-statement-on-acetaminophen-and-autism-/2025/09) [organizations ](https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/what-the-research-says-about-autism-and-tylenol-use-during-pregnancy/)rebuked the Trump administration on the claims surrounding Tylenol and autism.

What this whole situation highlights is what libertarians have been saying all along: government institutions are prone to political capture and agendas, and private organizations are able to advise the public even better than the government can. . It’s not that private institutions are perfect, but at least you can have competing viewpoints, second opinions, and independent research.

Doctors, labs, and journals don’t all have to agree. That’s a good thing. It gives people the ability to weigh different sources and make informed decisions for themselves. We don’t need one government approved narrative. Especially when that narrative can shift depending on who’s in office.

Decentralized healthcare doesn't mean chaos.

1nov81q,conspiracy,NoResponsibility1728,Trump says taking Tylenol while Pregnant causes Autism,"Why would Trump blame a BRAND NAME, ""Tylenol"" for autism instead of its combination of components?

""Tylenol"" is acetaminophen. There may be differing formulas depending on if you're talking a dry or gel pill, but why blame a brand name instead of a specific formula?

My best guess would be that Trump wants to drive down the sale of Tylenol specifically.

People in his voter base are not going to buy or use Tylenol regardless of pregnancy status if they believe it causes autism, they might even try to get it taken off of store shelves.

They will however, continue to buy and use acetaminophen, because they don't know that Tylenol is just a brand name for it, they'll think Tylenol itself is the autism causing chemical.

Knowing this, acetaminophen will still be used but the Tylenol brand and business will suffer financially and even socially.

So we have to think ""Why would Trump want to take out another business?"". Since that appears to be the true purpose here.

I don't personally know why, but I think we should start doing some research into if Tylenol or the CEO had any conflicts with Trump or his interests.",https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1nov81q/trump_says_taking_tylenol_while_pregnant_causes/,0,0,0,34,1758665915.0,/r/conspiracy/comments/1nov81q/trump_says_taking_tylenol_while_pregnant_causes/,self.conspiracy

🙄🙄🙄

OK, he and RFK jr HAD NO EVIDENCE of such a thing with Tylenol and Autism, but let's not let science get in the way of another way to control women. 

But when men ask why wouldn't women WANT to have children? Here's yet another reason we can give. 

Which brings me to the whole damn ""Let's blame women for everything"" rant.

You have to be *PERFECT* not to get blamed for any problems your kids might have. 

Did you have even a *sip* of alcohol over 9 months? 

Did you gain too much weight OR too little weight during your pregnancy?

Did you eat *perfectly* balanced, 100% organic meals? Meals that had not one bite of ultra processed food? 100% homemade? 

And I remember the days they blamed women with autistic children for being ""cold"" (google ""refrigerator moms"" if you don't know).

And now....WHAT! You took Tylenol when you had a fever of 103⁰!?! How dare you! (We know mom fevers are not good for the fetus). 

And lastly...I don't like this ""autism is a fate worse than death"" crap either. It is a spectrum and people on this spectrum have contributed untold positive wonders on the world. I think neurodivergency can be an absolute gift.

1ntcvti,neurodiversity,Ok-Application5294,Autism community reacts to Trump’s dangerous claims,"Last week, President Trump claimed there’s a link between paracetamol (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism. He suggested it was behind the “meteoric rise” in diagnoses and even implied doctors may stop recommending the medication.

These statements have been widely debunked by doctors, health officials, and medical researchers. A large 2024 Swedish study of 2.4 million children found [no evidence to support this claim](https://news.ki.se/no-link-between-paracetamol-use-during-pregnancy-and-autism-or-adhd-in-children). Experts stress that correlation is not causation, and misinformation like this undermines decades of peer-reviewed science.

Autistic voices have spoken out, warning that Trump’s comments risk shifting the narrative from supporting autistic people to trying to “eradicate” autism.

[The National Autistic Society](https://www.autism.org.uk/what-we-do/news/thousands-join-fight-against-president-trumps) branded Trump’s claims “dangerous, anti-science, and irresponsible,” saying such rhetoric devalues autistic people.

Doctors have stressed that autism is not a disease to be “cured,” but part of natural neurodiversity.

Huh? So now we've been forced to take Tylenol? Since when? One theory I've heard regarding autism is that the older you or your spouse is when you have a child, the higher the risk of having a child with autism or on the spectrum. I hope a doctor explains that to Leavitt since she's married to someone older than her parents. Geez, I hope they don't ban epidurals.

I didn't listen to this news conference, but I heard that Trump could not pronounce acetaminophen. Tylenol is a brand name for the over-the-counter pain reliever and fever reducer acetaminophen.

Hopefully, the makers of Tylenol can work something out like Corona did.

I den största epidemiologiska studien hittills inom området analyserade nästan 2.5 miljoner barn födda i Sverige mellan 1995 och 2019. Av dem var det 186 000 vars mammor tagit paracetamol under graviditeten. Studien jämförde barnen med sina syskon. På det sättet kunde de utesluta felkällor som annars kan förvränga resultaten.

Forskarna kunde INTE inte se några samband mellan paracetamol och autism, adhd eller intellektuell funktionsnedsättning. [Läs mer här.](https://nyheter.ki.se/inget-samband-mellan-paracetamol-under-graviditeten-och-adhd-eller-autism-hos-barnen)

1no1yld,disability,LabelsLie,Fake News : Autism vs. Tylenol Introduction,"Timeline: Autism vs. Tylenol Introduction

Donald Triplett’s birth and diagnosis predate the introduction of Tylenol by decades. The over-the-counter Tylenol brand (acetaminophen) was first introduced in 1955 by McNeil Laboratories ￼. By contrast, autism was identified and described in the early 1940s ￼, with Triplett’s case being “Case 1.” In other words, the first known autism patient was born in 1933 – over 20 years before Tylenol even existed on the market. This timeline is crucial for evaluating Trump’s suggestion. If acetaminophen use during pregnancy were the cause of autism, one would not expect clear cases of autism to appear long before Tylenol was available. Yet that is exactly what happened: children were being diagnosed with autism in the 1940s and 1950s well before Tylenol became common. This historical fact undercuts the plausibility of Trump’s insinuation that Tylenol is the root cause of autism. Autism’s prevalence has indeed risen in recent decades, but researchers largely attribute this rise to expanded diagnostic criteria and awareness, rather than a new exposure in the environment ￼. In short, autism existed independently of Tylenol, so it cannot be solely explained by the introduction of that drug.",https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1no1yld/fake_news_autism_vs_tylenol_introduction/,105,0,105,13,1758583745.0,/r/disability/comments/1no1yld/fake_news_autism_vs_tylenol_introduction/,self.disability

**Trump:** Hepatitis B is sexually transmitted. There's no reason to give a baby that's almost just born Hepatitis B. So I would say wait until the baby is 12 years old and formed and take Hepatitis B.

**Trump:** ""There are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines and don't take any pills that have no autism...The Amish, as an example, they have essentially no autism.""

**Trump:** ""We've got a lot of stupid people in this country running things."" - The one thing that he said that was true. 

**Trump:** ""I think it has -- I think it's very bad. They're pumping, it looks like they're pumping into a horse. You have a little child, a little fragile child, and you get a vat of 80 different vaccines, I guess. 80 different blends. And they pump it in. So ideally, a woman won't take Tylenol.""

**RFK Jr:** I've never seen a case of full-blown autism in a 70-year-old man. You're only seeing it in the kids. It's an epidemic.

**Trump:** ""Asceda -- well, let's see how we say that. Ascenem -- enophin. Acetaminophen. Is that okay”

**Trump:** I just want to say acetaminophen is basically tylenol, essentially, because I noticed this term is used throughout this conference, so it is essentially tylenol.

**Trump:** ""The MMR I think should be taken separately. This is based on what I feel.""

1npd8bf,Defeat_Project_2025,Odd-Alternative9372,3 thoughts from an autism researcher on Trump's acetaminophen and vaccine claims,"President Trump's suggestion that a link exists between autism and acetaminophen — the active ingredient in Tylenol — has raised concerns within the scientific community.

- Trump, along with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid chief Dr. Mehmet Oz, said Monday that autism rates are up because pregnant women are taking the medicine that is often used to treat pain and fever.

- ""Taking Tylenol is not good,"" Trump said during an announcement in which he also discouraged giving the medicine to young children. Tylenol's maker, Kenvue, told NPR in a statement that ""independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents.""

- Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence (CARE) at Boston University and founder of the Coalition of Autism Scientists, called the administration's announcement ""appalling."" She said it was ""a very significant distortion"" of what science says about any possible links between acetaminophen and autism.

- The message ""is likely to impact millions of lives of pregnant women right now. Mothers of autistic children who are going to be so fearful that this is what they did to cause their child's autism, which is absolutely not the case,"" Tager-Flusberg said.

- Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Tager-Flusberg, who has studied autism for decades, responded to claims Trump made about autism, acetaminophen and vaccines, and the FDA's move to label leucovorin as a treatment option for autism.

- At the White House Monday, Trump said pregnant patients should ""fight like hell not to take [acetaminophen]."" He continued saying: ""There may be a point where you have to and that – you'll have to work out with yourself. So don't take Tylenol.""

- A study released in August by Harvard University found that women who said they took acetaminophen while pregnant seemed more likely to have a child diagnosed with autism. Ann Bauer, an epidemiologist who worked on that study, told NPR she worried it was too soon for the federal government to offer guidance and that the research community needed to see more evidence.

- Tager-Flusberg said that if there is an association between acetaminophen and autism, it is ""small"" and ""limited"" and ""interacts most likely with the genetics, which is the main contribution to what causes autism.""

- She added, ""There's absolutely no evidence out there to support the kind of strong statement that we heard from President Trump.""

- Tager-Flusberg said the combination MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella) — which Trump also took aim at Monday — is ""perfectly safe"" and that research has completely debunked any links between it and autism. Study after study have found no link between autism and the vaccine, which is typically administered to children after their first birthday and again between ages 4 and 6, according to the CDC.

- On Monday, Trump suggested splitting the MMR vaccine's administration into multiple visits.

- ""Don't let them pump your baby up with the largest pile of stuff you've ever seen in your life, going into the delicate little body of a baby, even if it's two years, three years, four years, you just break it up into, I would say five, but let's say four, four visits to the doctor instead of one.""

- Tager-Flusberg said Trump raising the concern is ""likely to raise fear among mothers, confusion and chaos for pediatricians.""

- ""This is really not what our society needs right now,"" she added.

- The Food and Drug Administration also announced Monday that it would label leucovorin, a form of vitamin B typically used along with cancer medicines, as a treatment for speech-related deficits associated with autism.

- Tager-Flusberg said that while a ""promising"" small-scale study showed language improvement for a group of children who were administered leucovorin, the treatment has — at best — ""weak evidence in support of it.""

- She added that researchers need to build on early studies with a large-scale, randomized controlled trial and that they need to know what outcomes can be expected, dosage levels and which children to observe.

- ""We need a study to investigate this right now, far before the FDA … should be approving this medication,"" Tager-Flusberg said. ""They haven't done this for a single other medication in the history of autism.""",https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5550182/trump-vaccines-tylenol-autism-acetaminophen,140,0,140,5,1758723145.0,/r/Defeat_Project_2025/comments/1npd8bf/3_thoughts_from_an_autism_researcher_on_trumps/,npr.org

1nnpdii,evilautism,itsalongwalkhome,Trumps cure to autism? Or is it actually some Harvard deans attempt to get back the $2.2B he lost in federal funding before his department is cut?,"[There was report released in August that comprised of data from 46 studies adding up to 100,000 participants which showed a slight increase in autism rates of mums who consumed prenatal acetaminophen (Tylenol).](https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/using-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-may-increase-childrens-autism-and-adhd-risk/)

[One study of 180,000 kids that I read from April 2024 showed the same thing UNTIL you controlled for siblings. The conclusion was that Tylenol was NOT causing Autism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38592388/)

So they analysed more studies, but less participants? The President is cherry-picking data!

The guy who conducted the study Andrea Baccarelli, Dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, had significant [federal grant cuts](https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/trump-administration-freezes-2-2-billion-in-grants-to-harvard/), to which Harvard was going to [reduce the size of the school.](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/harvard-in-the-crosshairs/harvard-school-public-health-baccarelli) I beleive he has cherry-picked data to get more federal funding.

Andrea Baccarelli even acknowledged that this is a possibility, ""He notes that even government funding can subtly shape institutional priorities.""

From the article: ""For Baccarelli, the upheaval clarifies the mission: “Easy, quick, and cheap"""" No shit.

tldr: So they lost 2.2 Billion in federal funding 4 months ago and their department who lost $200 million of that, was looking to get downsized after already firing staff and suddenly they have the miracle answer Trump and RFK have been looking for, And all they did was analyse previous peer reviewed studies. They didnt conduct anything themselves, or find any new information.

What’s happening in the USA that your president can say things like that and get away with it?!

1no6y67,evilautism,PuzzleheadedLow6397,Trump finally gave me a reason to take paracetamol (FYI Doliprane is the french name for Tylenol),"
I used to not like taking paracetamol (for period pain) because I find it didn't work on me, and prefered taking ibuprophen (and don't change it since, you know autism). Which is a little dumb because due to the risks of cardiac disease and of ulcer (and on top of that my anxiety linked to reading side effects of the ISRS that I take because of, you know, autistic burnout) that makes me thinks this will absolutely happens one day even if I only take one or two pills a month) I rather not taking anything at all.
Now I have a reason to take paracetamol ! (this and the virus disease I have this week) My kids will be autistic² lol (don't want kids actually) 
And for info, since I'm French, I got it for free since it was prescribed (don't know why I mention it anywhere) ",https://i.redd.it/fx108opd3uqf1.png,122,0,122,3,1758598214.0,/r/evilautism/comments/1no6y67/trump_finally_gave_me_a_reason_to_take/,i.redd.it

1npfclj,behindthebastards,CryptoCentric,The New Atheists are Bastards,"Just yesterday, YouTube's Shaun dropped a new four-hour video absolutely shredding Lawrence Krauss's [stupid new book filled with racists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyU5Xkk6TuE&amp;t=10519s). (Shaun's connection to BTB and Robert is tangential but kinda neat, consisting of a shared admiration and friendship with Dan Olson, but I only point that out here because it's an interesting tidbit.) It's a long piece but a great one and highly worth the listen. 

Anyway, listening to this--especially the bit about Elizabeth Weiss, because I'm an archaeologist who was part of the movement to get her banned from presenting at the SAA Conference a few years back--reminded me of another article about some of these clowns: [Godless Grifters--How the New Atheists Merged with the Far Right](https://www.salon.com/2021/06/05/how-the-new-atheists-merged-with-the-far-right-a-story-of-intellectual-grift-and-abject-surrender/). 

The lineups are different but contain a lot of the same characters, including Richard Dawkins, Stephen Pinker, and Lawrence Krauss. I.e., the ""celebrity scientists"" who loved Jeffrey Epstein and his money lots and lots. 

And it got me thinking: would that make a good episode? I don't know if the CoolZone folks ever actually look at the sub, but just for discussion's sake I'm wondering what y'all think. Because I can't help but see a line connecting the Bastards of Celebrity Science and normalization of things like Trump and Wormbrain saying Tylenol causes autism.

My mother is on the path to agree and it’s making me so angry. But if I come at her with just anger and emotions, she won’t listen. 

She literally just told me, “well if there is a way to prevent it so families don’t have to suffer with an autistic child who bashes their head, wouldn’t you do it?” 

And I’m just so fucking speechless I can’t even think straight. 

My brother is high functioning autistic. There is a high probability that I am also autistic, I just haven’t been officially diagnosed.

And to hear my mom saying “well maybe it was Tylenol” is blowing my mind.

1nongzn,EmbryologyIVFSupport,embryomanofficial,Experts push back on Trump warnings about Tylenol in pregnancy and autism,"The FDA has added a warning to acetaminophen (paracetamol, Tylenol) about a “possible association” with autism in pregnancy, though scientists stress there’s no evidence it causes autism.

President Trump urged the public to avoid the drug entirely, and health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also pointed to vaccines, despite decades of studies showing no link. Their comments leaned on a Harvard and Mount Sinai review of 46 studies, which found some associations with neurodevelopmental disorders but emphasized that causation is unproven. 

In an interview, lead author Diddier Prada said, “We cannot answer the question about causation — that is very important to clarify.” 

Pregnant women may take acetaminophen for health problems such as infections or fevers, and those problems — not the drug — might cause the increased risk of developmental disorders.

Scientists say the larger, better-controlled studies show no link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism, with any associations being very small and not evidence of causation.

A Swedish study of 2.5 million children found no association when controlling for genetics and family health background (in sibling comparisons). “Genetics is the big unobserved elephant in the room,” said senior author Brian Lee.

Another large study from Japan with 200,000 children also found no link.

Researchers say better studies are needed with stronger data on genetics, dosage, and frequency, and warn that focusing only on acetaminophen oversimplifies autism. They also caution that discouraging its use could take away a safe option for pregnant people and fuel misinformation.
